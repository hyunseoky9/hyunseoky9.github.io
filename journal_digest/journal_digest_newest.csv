150,Ambitious forest biodiversity conservation under scarce public funds: Introducing a deferrence mechanism to conservation auctions,1.0,,,5.0,1.0,Ecological Economics,B,economics,Johanna Kangas; Janne S. Kotiaho; Markku Ollikainen,The European Union's Biodiversity Strategy sets an ambitious goal to increase the area of protected land and sea to 30% with 10% devoted to strict protection by 2030. The large land areas required to fulfil the conservation target and the quick schedule of implementation challenge both the current policy instruments and public funding for conservation. We introduce a deferrence mechanism for forest conservation by using procurement auctions. Deferring the conservation payments allows the government to conserve large areas in a quicker schedule and distributing the financial burden of conservation cost for a longer period of time. The deferred payments are paid an interest. The interest earning and an auction mechanism for downpayments strengthens the incentives for landowners to take part in conservation. We characterize the general properties of the mechanism and run numerical simulations to find that the deferrence mechanism facilitates a quick conservation of stands and thereby minimizes the loss of ecologically valuable sites caused by harvesting risks. The analysis suggests that keeping the lending period no longer than 10 years and paying a 3% interest rate provides a compromise that works rather well and outperforms the up-front mechanism in most cases.,api,0.87,0.9,,Conservation auctions with deferred payments directly address budgets/ROI and dynamic timing of investment; leverages land-market mechanisms to prioritize protected area expansion under scarce public funds.,,"Introduces and analyzes a deferred-payment conservation auction mechanism with budgets, timing, and optimization to expand protected forests under funding constraints.",,False,0,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2026.108931

Muir; Kelly Robinson,"Abstract Dams have dramatically altered rivers and are a major contributor to native fish population declines. However, many dams serve important ecological, social, and economic functions, such as flood control, invasive species control, and provision of recreational opportunities. Therefore, dam removal is often contentious among stakeholders and involves making tradeoffs among multiple competing objectives. This research uses structured decision making to evaluate the ecological, social, and economic consequences and tradeoffs of enhancing connectivity for migratory fishes in the Boardman River, Michigan. We describe efforts to engage a diverse group of stakeholders to elicit their objectives under various fish passage alternatives. We used multi‐attribute tradeoff methods to help stakeholders weigh the costs and benefits of enhancing connectivity for several fish species with varying life history traits and initial distributions. We found that the optimal alternative was passage of native fishes only; however, the optimal alternative varied based on the weight stakeholders might place on each objective. We created four objective weighting scenarios to evaluate the sensitivity of the optimal alternative to changes in objective weights. This research will help inform decision‐makers on fish passage alternatives that are preferred by stakeholders and that are likely to achieve their objectives.",,0.88,0.95,,"Applies structured decision making to weigh ecological, social, and economic trade-offs for selective fish passage—clear multi-objective prioritization and stakeholder-weighted optimization.",,"Structured decision making with multi-attribute tradeoff analysis identifies an optimal fish passage alternative, explicitly addressing stakeholder-weighted trade-offs.",,False,0,10.1111/csp2.70234

However, postponing decisions can be costly, both financially due to extended research efforts and ecologically due to missed opportunities for timely intervention. In structured decision‐making (SDM), these are known as information problems, where the challenge is deciding whether to act amid uncertainty or wait to gather more data. Constructed value of information (CVOI) is an emerging decision‐analytic tool that helps quickly identify which uncertainties are most critical to resolve. We propose that applying CVOI to an information problem in an initial SDM rapid prototype round can help identify key uncertainties that can subsequently be used in a decision tree, simplifying the decision context and enabling tractable analysis. We illustrate this approach through a two‐round SDM workshop focused on conservation planning for the endangered Curiously Isolated Hairstreak butterfly. In the first round, the decision was diagnosed as a multi‐objective information problem and we used CVOI to identify key uncertainties to potentially prioritize for research. In the second round, those uncertainties informed a recharacterization of the problem as a risk‐based decision, which we evaluated using decision trees. This case study demonstrates how CVOI can reduce analysis paralysis and support timely, effective conservation action.",,0.9,0.95,,Focuses on value of information within iterative SDM; uses CVOI to decide when to monitor vs act and simplifies to decision trees—core to monitoring vs management trade-offs.,,Structured decision-making case using constructed value of information and decision trees to prioritize uncertainties and actions under risk directly addresses conservation decisions with quantitative methods.,,False,0,10.1111/csp2.70228

Another consideration is whether the relative importance of different tenures varies depending on the specific goals of the PA network. We used the mammal fauna of the Australian monsoon tropics (AMT), one of the world's largest intact tropical savannas, as a case study to address these questions. We applied systematic conservation planning to identify optimal PA configurations under 2 objectives (adding to the existing PA network from any tenure vs. expanding the Indigenous protected area [IPA] network through voluntary declaration of Indigenous lands by traditional owners) and 2 species protection criteria (prioritizing currently threatened species vs. species predicted to become threatened). We calculated planning unit selection frequencies for the resulting 4 scenarios to identify high‐priority areas for mammal conservation and assessed their dependence on different tenure categories. All scenarios relied heavily on Indigenous lands to achieve species representation targets, with varying contributions from pastoral land depending on the criteria prioritized. Protecting potentially threatened species required more pastoral land and Indigenous land coexisting with primary industries, whereas targets for currently threatened species were more cost‐effectively met through voluntary declarations of Indigenous freehold land as IPAs. Our results highlight the potential for Indigenous lands to play a major role in achieving biodiversity conservation targets and demonstrate that land tenure requirements vary depending on conservation priorities. These findings emphasize the need to explicitly consider tenure in conservation planning to guide collaborative strategies and ensure PA growth aligns with specific biodiversity goals across diverse land management contexts.",api,0.88,0.85,,Systematic conservation planning for protected area growth with explicit land tenure constraints; prioritizes threatened vs potentially threatened species and highlights cost-effective Indigenous PA expansion.,,Applies systematic conservation planning optimization to prioritize protected area expansion across land tenures with cost-effectiveness and explicit conservation targets.,,False,0,10.1111/cobi.70143

Shiklomanov; Susannah B. Lerman,"Abstract Ecological restoration is essential to meeting global biodiversity conservation goals. Given limited conservation budgets, deciding where to restore habitat is a key challenge for the coming decade. We developed a spatially explicit framework to optimize ecological restoration site selection by integrating land use history, species distributions, and economic costs. The framework includes the following steps: identify potential restoration area based on relevant environmental measures like land use; identify species of interest; calculate restoration benefits by modeling habitat and climate suitability and estimating reduced extinction risk associated with restoring a particular land parcel based on a modified species–area relationship; aggregate benefits across species; and compare to parcel‐level land acquisition costs. We applied linear programming to maximize conservation benefit/restoration cost ratios to identify optimized restoration sites. We illustrate this approach using a case study for highly threatened grassland ecosystems in the Great Plains region of Kansas, USA. We selected five grassland animal species (greater prairie chickens [ Tympanuchus cupido ], lesser prairie chickens [ Tympanuchus pallidicinctus ], swift fox [ Vulpes velox ], pronghorn [ Antilocapra americana ], and regal fritillary [ Speyeria idalia ]) as indicators of restoration benefit across taxa. For the indicator species that we chose, shortgrass and mixed‐grass prairies had the highest conservation benefit to cost ratio. Setting a minimum restoration threshold for each habitat type allowed us to identify high‐priority tallgrass prairie sites. Despite increasing interest in ecological restoration, optimizing restoration site selection is challenging because one must consider habitat features that do not currently exist.

Ritchie; Jeffrey O. Hanson; Marika A. Maxwell; Adrian F. Wayne,"Abstract Interactions between threatening processes compound and accelerate biodiversity decline. Conservation managers need to understand how co‐occurring threats interact and account for such interactions when prioritising when, where and how to manage landscapes to recover declining species. Using the Upper Warren region in south‐western Australia as a case study, we develop a framework for identifying optimal fire age classes while also considering predation by introduced red foxes ( Vulpes vulpes )—two co‐occurring processes affecting the recovery of a threatened faunal community (woylie Bettongia penicillata , chuditch Dasyurus geoffroii , quenda Isoodon fusciventor and numbat Myrmecobius fasciatus ). We fitted a multi‐species relative abundance model to a dataset from 548 camera trap sites and tested for associations between each species' relative abundance, fox baiting intensity and time since fire. We then used linear programming optimisation to identify the optimal distribution of time since fire values across the study region that maximises the abundance of four focal species under alternative fox baiting intensity and fire severity scenarios. Fire and baiting both influenced the relative abundance of the four species in our study, with fox baiting intensity having a positive association with woylie relative abundance. The optimal distribution of time since fire values across the study region varied with the intensity of fox baiting. The importance of older fire ages increased in some locations when fox baiting intensity was high, but these results were highly uncertain and varied spatially. High fox baiting intensities combined with optimal fire age distributions also led to a higher relative abundance of three focal species overall, namely woylie, quenda and numbat.

We compared fully active planting strategy (s-FLR) with a hybrid restoration strategy (c-FLR) combining planting and natural regeneration in the Castelporziano case study, Italy. Over 50 years, a site-specific static and dynamic Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tracked net carbon balance and radiative forcing. Life cycle emissions reached 15.5 Mg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq ha<sup>-1</sup> for s-FLR and 12.1 Mg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq ha<sup>-1</sup> for c-FLR.

In relative terms, c-FLR offset 6.6 times its emissions, compared to 3.2 times for s-FLR. Although covering just one-fifth of the area, the passive component contributed more than half of the total C sequestration capacity of c-FLR. However, active planting remains crucial to steer succession and restore landscape identity, ensuring ecological memory is restored within a practical timeframe. Dynamic analysis revealed a stark contrast. While s-FLR warmed the climate for over a decade, c-FLR produced immediate cooling effects and climate benefits. These findings confirm how hybrid restoration strategies combine rapid climate mitigation with enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem resilience. Moreover, static metrics in C accounting can mislead climate policy. Dynamic, site-specific LCA emerges as a practical tool for optimizing restoration strategies across time and space.

Quantifying border gradients of species richness is essential to aligning ecological and management boundaries to enable the gradual integration of biodiversity hotspots in conservation strategies that include cross‐border areas that buffer the effects of extensive infrastructure.

Although 20.2% of existing protected areas were in the north, 27.7% of identified priority conservation areas were outside these protected areas and only 2.93% were protected. Threatened plant and animal richness exhibited a positive spatial correlation (coefficient = 0.12), but their richness hotspots were spatially mismatched. The richness of threatened species was positively correlated with carbon storage and soil retention, but negatively correlated with water retention. In contrast, threatened animal diversity showed the opposite pattern. Threatened species richness decreased as distance from the border increased (strong linear relationship, R 2 = 0.95 for plants and 0.59 for animals).

Achieving these goals requires protecting not only species and habitats but also the networks of biotic interactions that sustain them. Food webs, which represent predator‐prey interactions between species, are increasingly recognised as a link between ecosystem structure, function, and resilience, which are concepts that are frequently cited in conservation policy. Yet, conservation planning and policy typically focus on individual species and habitats and overlook the interactions that support their persistence. We review the literature at the intersection of food web ecology and conservation, and highlight how food webs can inform three conservation goals: preventing species extinctions, maintaining ecosystem functions and NCP, and fostering ecosystem resilience. Food web data and metrics, such as interaction diversity, trophic diversity, connectance, or modularity, can be used to prioritize species that are key to ecosystem structure and functioning, and to guide spatial prioritization to protect functionally diverse and resilient communities.

As climate change increasingly impacts ecosystems, long-term monitoring programs are especially valuable; decades-long datasets enable evaluation of ecosystem responses to climate change in the context of the system's historical behavior.

This study addresses a critical research gap by systematically evaluating how thinning regimes (frequency, intensity, timing and methods) jointly affect these dual objectives in Larix olgensis plantations. We developed an integrated stand-level management model incorporating carbon balance and timber production, optimized through a simulated annealing genetic algorithm (GASA). The Bayesian optimization method indicated the optimal parameter combinations of GASA were population size = 22, initial temperature = 10, cooling coefficient = 0.79, maximum iterations for external loop = 16, maximum iterations for internal loop = 45, and internal iteration count = 200, runtime = 55.64 ± 6.40 min. For stands with 3333 tree∙ha<sup>-1</sup> initial density and 16 m site index, the optimal composite management plan featured a 52-year rotation with five upper-layer thinning events, implemented at years 13, 18, 26, 32, and 39, with basal area-based thinning intensities of 12 %, 22 %, 25 %, 36 %, and 50 %, respectively. The net present value (NPV) of composite management is 302.09 thousand CNY∙ha<sup>-1</sup>, which is more 77.08 thousand CNY∙ha<sup>-1</sup> than that of conventional management. While composite management reduced timber NPV by 2.52 % relative to conventional management, the benefits of carbon balance fully compensated for the NPV reduction in timber production, and the substitution effects under composite management completely compensated for the NPV losses caused by carbon emission penalties from wood products. The discount rate had the greatest effect on NPV; when the rate reached extreme values, the NPV difference between the two management strategies narrowed, and the likelihood of adopting composite management decreased. Composite management increased the carbon balance by 25.83 %, exceeding the 18.47 % increase in timber production compared with conventional management.

In 2022, parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) adopted the Kunming‐Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), a strategic plan with 23 action‐oriented targets to be achieved by 2030. However, biodiversity action carries direct and indirect costs that are unevenly distributed globally. Moreover, parties to the CBD may differ relative to various aspects of bearing these costs. Although the GBF implicitly acknowledges its parties’ common but different responsibilities for its implementation, what this means in practice is left open. We suggested a distributive justice framework to guide global sharing of the costs of biodiversity action, with a focus on specific GBF targets. We combined the contributor pays, beneficiary pays, and ability to pay principles from the normative‐philosophical justice literature together with empirical information on trends in biodiversity degradation, benefits from resource exploitation, and livelihood levels in different countries to develop a distinct and comprehensive account of distributive justice in a global biodiversity policy context and to specify implications for target implementation. Our framework suggests that high‐income countries should provide substantial financial resources for the implementation of GBF targets domestically and internationally. Moreover, these countries have a particularly high moral obligation to take action to reduce pressure on biodiversity—for instance, by reducing pollution or changing consumption patterns.

However, until recently, there was insufficient knowledge on the distribution of inland wetlands and freshwater biodiversity to develop AOH mapping methods specifically tailored to inland wetlands. We used a combined empirical and thematic approach to translate inland wetland habitat classes in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Habitats Classification Scheme into spatially explicit wetland‐cover types derived from the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database 2 and the World Karst Aquifer Map. The AOH was subsequently estimated as the area in the mapped range that corresponded to each species’ habitat and elevation associations. We developed and tested the method with IUCN Red List assessment data, range maps, and point locality data for fishes, odonates, decapod crustaceans, and mollusks (22,876 species). The method performed well in comparison with similar methods already developed for terrestrial mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles. The mean map prevalence (proportion of area in a species’ range that was AOH) was 18–32% for each taxonomic group. Based on data on known localities of occurrence, 78–100% of species per taxonomic group had a higher classification accuracy than expected if AOH were distributed in the range at random.

Calabrese","Abstract Reports in the literature of mass mortality events (MMEs) involving diverse animal taxa are increasing. Yet, many likely go unobserved due to imperfect detection and infrequent sampling. MMEs involving small, cryptic species, for instance, can be difficult to detect even during the event, and degradation and scavenging of carcasses can make the window for detection very short. Such detection biases make it difficult to understand trends in MMEs across time, regions, or taxa. Thus, we developed a simple modeling framework to clarify key aspects (e.g., sampling frequency, dynamics of detectability) of the problem and spur future work. Our framework describes the probability of detecting an MME as a function of the observation frequency relative to the rate at which MMEs become undetectable. Although simple, this framework is useful for developing an intuition about how the probability of detecting a randomly occurring MME increases with peak detectability, with slower rates of decay in detectability, and with more frequent observations. It can also facilitate the design of surveillance programs. To illustrate its utility, we applied it to Ranavirus ‐related MMEs in 35 populations of an endangered salamander subspecies. We found that the probability of detecting an MME was &lt;50% and that the frequency of MMEs in this system was likely much greater than the one MME observed in the 35 ponds.

Hayes; Aaron N. Johnston; L. Embere Hall; Jill Randall; Matthew Kauffman; Chris Keefe; Kevin L. Monteith; Tabitha A. Graves,"Abstract Wildlife and their habitats face profound challenges from climate and landscape‐scale changes that extend beyond the influence and time horizon of most biologists and land managers. In this changing environment, long‐term datasets can enhance assessments of how demographic trends respond to interactions among local (e.g., habitat restoration decisions) and broad extent drivers, including energy development, to shape wildlife populations. Although many studies evaluate habitat selection or demographics for a single population, our multipopulation, multiscale study quantifies the influence of local management actions given broader environmental forces using both immediate and lagged effects. This approach may be particularly important for species with high site fidelity that may have less adaptive capacity, including mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ), which are experiencing widespread population declines. We analyzed a 40‐year (1980–2019) dataset for 37 mule deer populations across Wyoming, USA, to test hypotheses about and quantify the relative influence of conditions within winter use areas on annual rates of juvenile recruitment. Recruitment has been strongly affected by multiple factors largely beyond the control of managers. Land cover (agriculture and shrubland) had the largest positive effects on recruitment, with estimates more than twice the magnitude of other variables, but also had limited presence in some winter use areas. The next strongest effect sizes were shared by energy developments (including oil/gas and wind energy) and climatic conditions, which, except for wind turbines, had broad distributions across winter use areas. Recruitment increased with higher mean winter temperatures and summer precipitation, but declined with wind, oil and gas developments, cumulative drought, and wildfire. Expected increases in drought and decreases in summer precipitation may constrain options to sustain mule deer populations. Although mule deer recruitment may sometimes be enhanced through habitat restoration, effects varied with treatment type, habitat type, and time since treatment. Given large constraining effects of temperature and drought, supporting drought resiliency for important habitat may be useful. Our results can be used to weigh the relative strength of threats and the value of restoration actions, interpret historic demographic change, prioritize populations for conservation, and optimize options for wildlife habitat management.",,0.78,0.85,,,Integrates climate and anthropogenic dynamics with management actions across multiple populations to inform prioritization and optimize restoration under constraints—relevant to adaptive management and trade-off evaluation.,"Multi-population, multi-decade modeling integrates climate and anthropogenic drivers to prioritize threats and inform habitat management for declining mule deer.",,False,0,10.1002/eap.70107

Hobbs; Stephanie M. Carlson; Albert Ruhí,"Abstract Major estuaries globally are experiencing fast‐paced changes in hydrology and ecosystem dynamics. However, connecting alteration of river flow regimes to estuarine fish population dynamics remains a challenge, partly due to the untested assumption that flow regimes, fish dynamics, and the resulting flow–ecology relationships are stationary (i.e., have no systematic changes in mean or variance over time). Here, we studied the endangered population segment of Longfin Smelt ( Spirinchus thaleichthys ) in the San Francisco Estuary, which depends on seasonal river flows to reproduce. We used extensive biomonitoring data (1980–2020) and two time‐series modeling techniques, namely multivariate autoregressive state‐space (MARSS) models and dynamic linear models (DLMs), to understand how population dynamics respond to interannual flow variation, and whether flow–ecology relationships have changed over time. MARSS outputs showed that population trajectories are best explained by a combination of lateral and vertical dimensions of habitat structure, that is, whether individuals were collected in channels versus shoals, and in pelagic versus benthic environments. In turn, DLMs revealed time‐varying, but often positive effects of flow on young‐of‐the‐year abundance in shallow channel and shoal habitats, but no consistent relationships for older individuals (age‐1+), likely due to other drivers influencing survival from age‐0 and age‐1+. Finally, we found that the two modeling approaches showed agreement only in about 30% of the cases. Divergence in the sign and/or magnitude of flow effects suggests that time‐averaged approaches may sometimes oversimplify non‐stationary relationships between the environment and fish population dynamics. From a conservation standpoint, the gradually weakening but positive flow–ecology relationship (as opposed to a step change in the relationship) suggests that it may still be possible to reverse the steep population declines of Longfin Smelt through a combination of flow and habitat restoration actions. While we focused on a particular endangered population, our quantitative approach is transferable to other taxa and geographies, and could help inform management of flow‐dependent resources in systems strongly affected by non‐stationarity. We contend that time‐varying flow–ecology relationships are needed to better capture ecological realism, and could help design more effective conservation strategies in fast‐changing environments.",,0.72,0.8,,,"Time-varying flow–ecology modeling for an endangered fish supports adaptive management under non-stationarity, linking hydrological decisions to species outcomes in a dynamic, data-driven framework.",Time-varying state-space and dynamic linear models link flow regimes to endangered fish dynamics to guide flow and habitat restoration actions in a changing system.,,False,0,10.1002/eap.70178

Zachariah Peery,"Abstract Climate and land‐use change are dramatically altering the frequency, intensity, and extent of ecological disturbances, which threaten the persistence of at‐risk species. To curb the pace and scale of disturbances, balance management and conservation priorities, and alleviate associated population declines, managers require high‐quality information on species' responses to disturbance and their population trends across broad spatial scales that challenge the capacity of traditional, local‐scale monitoring programs. Passive acoustic monitoring is a scalable approach to obtain occurrence data, but the extent to which it can be used to model occupancy dynamics and their environmental drivers remains uncertain. Here, we demonstrate how passive acoustic surveys can be analyzed within a Bayesian dynamic occupancy modeling framework to robustly estimate occupancy dynamics and responses to disturbance in the California spotted owl ( Strix occidentalis occidentalis ), which is threatened by increasingly large, severe “megafires.” From 2021 to 2024, we collected ~2 million hours of audio from autonomous recording units deployed across seven national forests in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Spotted owls were less likely to initially occupy and colonize sites that were severely burned, and more likely to go locally extinct following high‐severity fire. Further, we observed declining postfire occupancy trajectories, particularly when sites burned ≥50% high severity. Occupancy trends varied by national forest, but declined by 2% across the entire region. Our findings—which closely align with those from intensive, traditional demographic studies—demonstrate that large‐scale passive acoustic monitoring paired with dynamic occupancy models can effectively detect species' responses to disturbance and estimate population trends, offering valuable insights for management across multiple spatial scales.

Bustamante‐Sánchez; Leland K. Werden,"Abstract Global restoration targets often rely on restoration prioritization maps that highlight areas with high ecological potential, yet real‐world implementation frequently diverges due to land tenure, governance and local socio‐economic conditions. Following a large‐scale forest fire in 2017 that burned over 500,000 ha, Chile's Ministry of Environment designated 270,677 ha as priority zones for landscape restoration in the Maule Region of central Chile. Using this context as a case study, we show how smallholders play a decisive role in shaping where and how restoration actually occurs on‐the‐ground. A comparison with official records and field data from 1922 ha of forest restoration implemented between 2017 and 2024 reveals a clear disconnect: only 12.7% of this restored area overlapped with the 270,677 ha designated by the government as priority zones. Instead, 87% of the total restored area occurred on lands owned by private smallholders, even though they collectively own only about one‐fifth of the total land within these priority zones. To bridge the gap between model‐driven prioritization and real‐world conditions, we propose three practical steps: (i) integrate land tenure and governance into spatial planning, (ii) redesign incentives to support smallholders and (iii) adopt adaptive, co‐produced frameworks. Refining outreach and incentives for corporate and state landholders is also key to broader engagement. Synthesis and applications . Chile's experience highlights that smallholders are not refining top‐down restoration priorities; they are revealing where restoration is actually feasible. They restore in places where tenure, logistics and livelihoods align, exposing the existing limitations of widely used prioritization models and clarifying where restoration can realistically occur.

Hayes; Joe Roman,"Human activities such as land conversion and resource consumption can cause species declines, which in the United States can result in listing for protection and recovery under the Endangered Species Act. Often highly charismatic species, such as bald eagles, grizzly bears, Pacific salmon, and North Atlantic right whales, get linked to human activity and social conflict emerges. This conflict can drive significant investment in a species’ recovery, including the suspension or alteration of multiple human activities, particularly when the species’ needs overlap with human activities such as food production, water management, and energy extraction. Analogous to keystone species, which directly influence their ecosystem through biological activity, we define these endangered and threatened species as keystone management species (KMS), because they prompt people to alter or undo their impacts on ecosystems through management activities that might not occur without that species’ charisma or social value. The phenomenon of these KMS under the ESA appears to be single species management at a surface level, but it is much more complex, often with cascading benefits to other species, while also increasing coordination across multiple sectors, resulting in ecosystem-based management. We review several case studies including the bald eagle’s emergence as one of the first KMS, following its dramatic recovery after the banning of DDT and widespread reintroduction projects; Pacific salmon’s influence on western land and water management and hydropower; the grizzly bear’s influence on western land and community waste management; and the North Atlantic right whale’s current influence on commercial fisheries and shipping and emerging influence on offshore aquaculture, marine renewable energy, and other marine activities.",,0.57,0.85,,,"Concept of Keystone Management Species under the ESA shows how endangered species management catalyzes cross-sector, ecosystem-based management—linking single-species mandates to broader conservation outcomes.","Conceptual/review piece framing ESA-listed species as keystone management species driving ecosystem-based management across sectors, with strong decision orientation though largely qualitative.",,False,0,10.3389/fcosc.2025.1645471

Moreno; Juan Carlos Illera,"Abstract Protected areas represent cornerstones of biodiversity conservation on oceanic islands, yet their effectiveness for endemic species remains poorly evaluated. We assessed how various territorial protection categories conserve an endemic oceanic bird by comparing periods of population maxima and minima in Fuerteventura. Using 500‐m transects across the island, we analyzed local abundance differences inside versus outside protected areas, identified proportions of populations within protection boundaries, and examined cohabitation patterns with other avian species. Local stonechat abundance was significantly higher only inside Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) (non‐targeted to birds), with no advantage in Special Protection Areas for Birds (SPAs), despite their avian conservation purpose (i.e., targeted to birds). Temporal analyses revealed a sharper decline in stonechat abundance inside SACs compared to unprotected areas, and similar changes outside and inside SPAs. Approximately 42% of the stonechat population and 72% of its occupancy area remained outside SPA boundaries during both periods, demonstrating inefficient spatial alignment with the species' distribution. Unprotected areas gained critical significance during the 2024 population minimum, as static boundaries failed to capture the species' shifting distribution patterns. The stonechat showed positive associations with five other endemic subspecies but no spatial overlap with emblematic “flagship” species that typically drive conservation decisions.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are one of the most common conservation tools being implemented worldwide to reach conservation targets. However, their implementation does not usually take the heterogeneous distribution of bentho‐demersal communities into account. This has led to uneven conservation of existing communities, resulting in the misinterpretation of current protection coverage levels. Here, we mapped the distribution of the bentho‐demersal community of the Balearic Sea, in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, using a joint species distribution model of 129 species of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods. We identified three distinct bioregions, and found that only 3.13% of the Shelf, 2.96% of the Upper slope and 0.89% of the Middle slope bioregions are covered by the 1089 km 2 of demersal no‐take MPAs included in our analyses. Bentho‐demersal communities were distributed mostly as a factor of bathymetry, but were also clearly delimited by bottom temperature, and had lower species‐rich communities in deeper bioregions. Furthermore, we found a negative effect of bottom trawl fishing on species richness in more heavily fished locations. Our results allow for the evaluation of an already implemented MPA network in the Balearic Sea, and suggest that more coverage is needed to fulfill current conservation set at the European and international levels.

This widespread land‐use change isolates wildlife into human‐dominated landscapes, intensifying conflicts over space and resources. Crop raiding is one of the most severe and widespread forms of human–wildlife conflict (HWC), undermining rural livelihoods and reducing support for the conservation of large vertebrates, especially those incurring high local costs despite high global conservation value. The white‐lipped peccary ( Tayassu pecari ), a large‐herd‐living tropical ungulate and key ecological engineer, has been extirpated from much of its former range. Yet, it is considered a pest in Mato Grosso, the leading Brazilian state in soybean and maize production. We used GPS tracking, landholder interviews and landscape variables to model crop‐raiding risk across ~28,000 rural properties in Mato Grosso. The total suitable conflict area covers 849,009 ha, potentially causing annual economic losses of US$664 million. Forest cover and connectivity were the most important predictors of conflict risk. Smallholders manage proportionally more vulnerable land than largeholders.

We examined how landowner and land use characteristics, motivations for program participation, perceptions of land management effort, and program characteristics were related to habitat quality across stages of a program. We used a mail survey to examine engagement and perceptions of habitat management across landholders, from newly enrolled to those in the post‐completion stage. We conducted on‐site habitat assessments for a subsample of landowners to assess habitat condition. We found that habitat condition ratings decreased before program completion, during the monitoring stage, and remained at a similar level afterward.

St. John, Leejiah Dorward, Harriet Ibbett, Martina Feilzer","Abstract Urgency to save species from extinction has prompted increased investment in law enforcement in protected areas. To date, such law enforcement has largely focused on increasing costs and reducing opportunities for offending. However, these resource‐intensive approaches are not always effective and can contribute to conflict between people and conservation authorities, undermining human well‐being and conservation goals. Drawing on criminal justice research, we considered how procedural justice theory—which examines how fair process and the perceived legitimacy of rules and enforcers influence behavior— could enhance understanding of compliance dynamics and complement existing law enforcement approaches, particularly in addressing low‐level noncompliance in protected areas. We also explored how principles of procedural justice have been incorporated in general policing and outlined challenges and opportunities to integrating this approach into conservation law enforcement. We considered key opportunity‐based (e.g., routine activity theory) and actor‐based frameworks (e.g., deterrence theory) underpinning most protected areaenforcement. We then focused on procedural justice theory and the role of legitimacy in encouraging compliance. Evidence from general policing shows that when enforcers treat citizens fairly, listen, and make decisions objectively, they gain trust and legitimacy. In turn, people are more inclined to comply with laws and cooperate with enforcers. Procedural fairness can be implemented during encounters by embracing 4 pillars: neutrality, voice, respect, and trustworthiness. Outlining challenges of integrating this approach in conservation law enforcement, we highlight the need to address limited public trust in state authority and other factors including working conditions of enforcers. Alongside ensuring the integrity and accountability of conservation law enforcement, we argue that embedding principles of procedural fairness into interactions between enforcers and citizens could reduce low‐level noncompliance. Success, however, requires conservation law enforcement to be reconceptualized by placing procedural fairness and legitimacy on a more equal footing with deterrence in research and practice.",api,0.66,0.85,,,,Applies procedural justice theory to conservation law enforcement to improve compliance and management decisions with structured decision framing.,"Applies procedural justice from criminal justice to conservation law enforcement in PAs—an unexpected but relevant lens for improving compliance, reducing conflict, and addressing environmental justice alongside deterrence.",False,0,10.1111/cobi.70094

Although a variety of interventions have been introduced to mitigate HEC, rigorous evaluations of how they affect mortality are practically nonexistent. Using a 20‐year dataset from Sonitpur district in Assam, India, we examined whether organized guarding and short‐distance drives—which are used to manage HEC in several countries globally—led to a reduction in human and elephant mortality from conflict as intended. We controlled for changes in land use and economic development, spillover effects, and nonrandom selection of villages for intervention. Results on whether organized guarding provided protection against human death due to HEC were inconclusive. Contrary to expectations, the intervention was associated with an approximate 2.0–2.9 times increase in elephant mortality. Disaggregation based on cause of mortality suggested that elephants may be more likely to be killed accidentally in villages where organized guarding occurs.

Gigliotti,"Abstract Conservation efforts are increasingly required to move beyond single‐species perspectives and towards community‐level inferences. Obtaining reliable multispecies population size estimates poses practical challenges as analytical tools and design recommendations are primarily focused on single species. Density estimation using spatial capture–recapture methods requires deploying detectors (e.g. camera‐traps) with spacing proportional to the space use of the focal species. Given that the design itself is species‐specific, sampling can be inefficient for species with larger ranges than the focal species due to restricted spatial coverage and insufficient for species with smaller ranges because fewer recaptures are generated. To address this practical issue, we developed a two‐stage optimization approach to generate camera‐trap survey designs that are appropriate for estimating density of a suite of individually identifiable species that vary in home range sizes. Our approach applies an algorithm to first optimize placement of a subset of detectors for large and vagile species based on maximizing spatial coverage, followed by a second optimization for the remaining cameras based on maximizing spatial recaptures for smaller and less mobile species. We empirically tested our approach using six individually identifiable carnivore species with varying home range sizes in the Munywana Conservancy, South Africa. Our design included 60 camera locations optimized for leopards ( Panthera pardus ) and 40 cameras optimized for small‐bodied, less‐mobile carnivores. Our design optimization procedure generated designs characterized by a distribution of inter‐trap distances, based on ecological parameters, and resulted in plausible density estimates for all species. The two‐stage approach resulted in moderate precision gains for larger ranging species and, importantly, substantial gains for smaller ranging species. Simulations demonstrated improved precision of spatially explicit capture–recapture (SCR) parameter estimates for all species compared to standard grid‐based designs, driven not solely by increased sampling but also by the optimized spatial configuration.

Tropical regions are particularly critical to climate mitigation due to their high carbon density and ongoing conversion to agricultural uses. While earth observation (EO) has become fundamental for assessing land-use change over time and space, key gaps persist in understanding associated carbon emissions (CE) and their distribution across production systems, information required by diverse international and European policy frameworks targeting greenhouse gas reduction and deforestation. To address this, the study integrates satellite-derived aboveground biomass (AGB) with machine learning-based land-use modeling to quantify commodity-specific CE from deforestation in Colombia. Our key findings reveal that pasture expansion for livestock dominates emissions (&gt;67% in the Amazonas and Orinoquía regions, approximately 25% nationally), while cocoa and coffee, despite smaller cultivation areas, exhibit high emission factors (&gt;25% of subregional totals in the Andes, Pacífico, and Caribe). Smallholder croplands contribute up to 16.7% regionally, and oil palm plays a modest role nationally. These results underscore the importance of targeting both extensive pasture systems and high-emission perennial crops in deforestation-free supply chain policies, while considering the diverse regional land-use dynamics. In conclusion, our framework offers spatially explicit, crop-specific emission estimates that address essential gaps in EO-based CE quantification. It provides clear, actionable baselines for monitoring policies aimed at promoting deforestation-free supply chains, such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), across tropical landscapes.

López‐Hoffman","Abstract The Intergovernmental Science–Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services has called for assessments explicitly accounting for interregional flows of ecosystem services (ESs) across geographic scales. An important type of interregional ES flow is generated by the long‐distance movements of migratory species. Many migratory species provide important benefits to people, and due to migration dynamics, ESs provided in one location may be affected by habitat conservation, or lack thereof, in other locations. The state of the science on interregional flows of ESs from migratory species, however, is nascent and lacks structure needed to consistently characterize flows. We developed a 4‐tiered system for categorizing assessments and the conclusions they can support based on 4 levels of ecological and socioeconomic information, ranging from incomplete to high, and how they are combined. The 4 tiers of assessment are based on differing levels of detail in the estimation of system‐level ecological and socioeconomic information on a species and the services it provides: telecoupled ESs, qualitative flows, quantitative static flows, and quantitative dynamic flows. Recent assessment studies largely fall within the first tier, which does not quantify flows. Socioeconomic and ecological information are needed to achieve each tier. Our framework can be used to identify and classify a range of methods, with varying time and data requirements, that can be used to maximize the information content and relevance of ES assessments for migratory species based on available resources.",api,0.66,0.85,,,,"Tiered framework for interregional ecosystem service flows from migratory species informs conservation assessments and planning, mainly conceptually.","Tiered framework for interregional ecosystem service flows from migratory species links qualitative to dynamic models—guiding when to invest in better data (VOI) vs. action and enabling multi-region, sequential conservation planning.",False,0,10.1111/cobi.70008

Penman,"Fire management under changing climatic conditions presents several challenges, including the need to manage fire regimes for multiple objectives, such as reducing risk to people while also protecting or maintaining the environment. One approach that could be added to existing management toolkits is green firebreaks. Green firebreaks are strategically placed low flammability plantings aimed at improving habitat and carbon storage while reducing fire risk. However, green firebreaks have not yet been explored in the context of shifting climates. Here, we use spatially explicit fire simulations in a fire regime simulation tool (FROST) to test green firebreak effectiveness under climate change across five landscapes in south-eastern Australia. We simulated fire regimes with and without green firebreaks and in conjunction with prescribed burning in the surrounding landscape. We evaluated effectiveness by examining changes in area burnt, fire frequency, and risk to people, property and the environment. In three out of the five regions, annual area burnt was predicted to increase under future climate trajectories and in most regions the introduction of green firebreaks decreased area burnt in one or both climate epochs but often resulted in increased fire frequency. When both green firebreaks and prescribed burns were used, area burnt, and fire frequency declined in most regions. Results were variable between climate models, reflecting how changes in precipitation and fuel load influenced management effectiveness i.e. prescribed burns and green firebreaks, under future climate predictions. Risks to people and property generally increased slightly with green firebreaks because additional fuel was introduced into the landscape. However, these risks were also negated when prescribed burning was also applied. As a stand-alone fire management method, green firebreaks may not be suitable for every location. However, when used in conjunction with other methods, such as prescribed burning, they could be a viable solution for managing fire and providing co-benefits to the environment.",api,0.7,0.95,,,,Spatial fire regime simulations evaluate green firebreaks and prescribed burning under climate change with trade-offs and risk metrics to inform management decisions.,,False,0,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2026.181459

On steep terrain, traditional fire hazard reduction treatments, such as uniform thinning, are often ineffective because they fail to disrupt the alignment of wind, slope, and flammable canopy fuels that drive crown fire propagation. This study addresses the need for effective, ecologically grounded strategies to mitigate crown fire behavior in steep, dry Scots pine forests by applying and evaluating an innovative pyro-silvicultural treatment implemented over 40 ha. Grounded in fire behavior physics under a closer-to-nature approach, the treatment increased forest structural heterogeneity and reduced crown fuel continuity through a two-order network of elliptical canopy gaps. Larger gaps were oriented along the expected fire-spread direction to disperse convective heat, while smaller transverse gaps were designed to limit crown fire sustainment along the flanks. Using the physics-based Wildland-urban interface Fire Dynamics Simulator (WFDS), post-treatment simulations showed reductions in heat release, air temperature, fire rate of spread, and crown fuel consumption. These changes indicate altered convective dynamics, fragmentation of the fire front, and a transition toward surface fire behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of spatially explicit canopy manipulation in mitigating crown fire sustenance.

In marine ecosystems, invasions are difficult to monitor and control, thus management strategies that can enhance biotic resistance are the key to tackling invasion risks. However, the biotic resistance of marine ecosystems is poorly understood with respect to the influencing factors and regulating mechanisms. We used an individual‐based modelling approach to predict the potential risks of a biological invasion event from an ecosystem perspective, and tested how fishing as a driving factor of ecosystem structure can alter biotic resistance. We considered a species of high invasive risk globally, European green crab ( Carcinus maenas ) as an example, and evaluated its invasion risk in a heavily exploited ecosystem Haizhou Bay, China. Further, we illustrated the role of fishery management to improve biotic resistance in order to inform the development of resistance‐enhancing strategies. We found the Haizhou Bay ecosystem would be vulnerable to the invasion of the green crab, while reducing fishing intensity by half could effectively enhance its biotic resistance by decreasing the invasion success rate by up to 52%. Alternatively, the reduced predation pressure experienced by juvenile C. maenas would largely contribute to successful invasions. Fishing activities could regulate the predation pressure by changing predator biomass and trophic links within the ecosystem, and thereby alter the biotic resistance to invasion. We further designed a range of simplified management strategies that controlled the fishing efforts on selected predators and illustrated their effectiveness to enhance biotic resistance. These strategies could mediate the trade‐offs between fisheries production and ecosystem management to a certain degree. Synthesis and applications. We validated the predation‐based hypothesis of biotic resistance in marine ecosystems and illustrated that fishery management can enhance biotic resistance by changing ecosystem structure. Based on this mechanism, fishery management strategies could simultaneously enhance biotic resistance and reduce management conflicts.

We conducted a global meta-analysis of 2975 paired yield and topsoil carbon (and 498 subsoil) observations from 510 publications to assess the simultaneous impacts of reduced tillage, cover cropping, complex crop rotations, and crop residue retention on maize, wheat, rice, and soybean yields and soil organic carbon stocks. Strong coupling between crop yield and soil carbon gains occurred in only 18.1% of observations, but significant gains in either outcome occurred in 55.6%. Environmental conditions mattered across all practices and crop types: win-wins were most likely in marginal agricultural lands characterized by warmer temperatures, water limitation, and low nitrogen application rates - conditions that represent a substantial proportion of global agricultural land area. By considering the interactions between crop types and multiple practices thought to bolster soil carbon stocks and crop yields, we conclude that the optimal practice for maximizing the yield response is not always the same as the optimal practice for maximizing the soil carbon response.

Evidence from Slovenia,,,,3.0,1.0,Journal of the Total Environment,B,applied_ecology,Štefan Bojnec; Imre Fertő,"Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture is a key objective of the European Union's Green Deal and is among considerations of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Agri-environmental schemes (AES) are the main CAP instruments to promote more sustainable farming, yet their short-term climate effectiveness remains uncertain. This study provides the first farm-level evidence for Slovenia on whether AES participation reduces GHG emission intensity and whether effects differ across production systems. Using a balanced panel of 227 farms from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (2014-2021), we estimate dynamic treatment effects of AES adoption on net carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions per hectare, applying modern difference-in-differences (DiD) estimators for staggered adoption and extensive robustness checks, including alternative estimators, placebo tests, and dynamic conditioning. Results show that AES adopters had higher pre-adoption emission intensity, consistent with targeted uptake by higher-emission farms. However, estimated reductions in emission intensity during the first one to two years after adoption are small, statistically insignificant, and robust across specifications. These findings suggest that broad, practice-based AES may not deliver immediate, measurable climate benefits at the farm level, either because effects take longer to materialize or because current schemes are insufficiently targeted to high-emission sources.

This study explored this synergy by assessing stakeholder perceptions of local ES and comparing them with existing scientific assessments in the NW coastal area of Portugal. Stakeholders representing four societal sectors (Quadruple Helix framework) prioritized regulation and maintenance ES (RMES), identified RMES supply areas and pressures, and outlined a 20‐year vision for the region. Stakeholders classified 16 of the 20 RMES as ‘Very Important’, particularly erosion control, buffering mass movements, coastal protection, or climate regulation .

Despite financial and political support for global forest restoration initiatives, projects continue to face persistent challenges and trade‐offs between environmental, climatic and socio‐economic goals. To better understand existing and future challenges and opportunities, we convened a diverse panel of 25 international experts from academia, science and policy organisations, funding agencies and the private sector. Through a structured expert elicitation process, we collectively identify seven key socio‐ecological issues likely to substantially shape forest restoration in low and middle‐income countries over the next decade. The identified issues are linked to: (i) adverse environmental impacts of poorly designed forest restoration initiatives; (ii) continued inattention to human well‐being and diverse values; (iii) the funding gap for long‐term restoration and challenges of private investment; (iv) new power dynamics and elites; (v) the looming technological revolution from Artificial Intelligence and related technologies; (vi) increasing need for adaptation to climate change to be built into restoration practice; and (vii) increasing competition and contestation for land. Our findings reinforce rising concerns that current restoration paradigms, which often favour large‐scale carbon‐centric interventions, risk undermining environmental and social outcomes. Whether emerging AI technologies and diversified private‐sector funding mechanisms can support community‐led, bottom‐up restoration depends on establishing robust regulatory frameworks, equitable access to technology and capacity building. Raising awareness of these unresolved and emerging issues can help to inform forest restoration practice that is ecologically effective, more equitable and resilient to future change. Success depends on policymakers and practitioners seizing emerging opportunities while critically evaluating current practices to ensure they promote, rather than undermine, these goals.

We employed a survey, which was administered to farmers and other stakeholder groups (e.g. local authorities, hunters, conservationists and the tourist industry). We included in data collection participants in new multi‐stakeholder platforms, established under a contract of the European Commission in 2018, and platforms having been set up earlier and still operating in Sweden and Finland. We launched the survey in two rounds, with a time frame in‐between of one full year of platform operation. Compared to other stakeholder groups, farmers attended more meetings in both new and old platforms. Perceived human–carnivore conflict in new platforms remained more or less stable in the first and second round of questionnaire administration, while the perception of stakeholder interaction changed from conflictual to collaborative for farmers and other stakeholders. In the second round, stakeholder negotiation and collaboration were much more pronounced within new platforms. We found that platforms were perceived to promote positive stakeholder interaction allowing space for negotiation between groups already in the first round. Considering that participants in new platforms believed that collaboration between stakeholders was the norm in the second round, we may infer that new platforms supported constructive stakeholder interaction. Farmers reported that they worked well with key stakeholders, and it was revealed that they were trusted as much or even more than other stakeholders. In the second round, farmers in new platforms focused their attention on damage prevention measures and on improving measures and tools available in Rural Development Programmes.

People tend to feed wildlife more regularly as it is often popularised by social media and can counteract their disconnect from the natural world. These interactions impact wildlife behaviour, feeding ecology and zoonotic transmission dynamics. Due to the risks involved, wildlife practitioners seek effective management strategies to protect both visitors and wildlife from injuries, disease spread and further consequences for wildlife behaviour and population dynamics. We present here, for the first time, a 7‐year longitudinal study on the changing trends of visitors feeding fallow deer in an urban park in response to three management campaigns conducted before, during and after the COVID‐19 pandemic. Each contributed to our understanding of the successes, failures and lasting impacts (if any) of these management actions under different social contexts and park accessibility. While the campaigns were somewhat successful in immediately reducing feeding levels, their impacts were not lasting and feeding increased in subsequent years. Management campaigns can be difficult to implement due to financial, logistical and priority‐alignment constraints, emphasising the importance of investing in measures that work and are sustainable long term. Constantly changing audiences, a sense of entitlement to wildlife interactions, and a mismatch between scientific research and management needs remain strong barriers to the alleviation of human–wildlife conflicts.

In the Central Annamite Landscape, Vietnam, initiatives like Payment for Forest Environment Services (PFES) for watershed protection, forest restoration, and non‐timber forest product development program seek to enhance conservation‐based livelihoods. A survey of 120 households across four villages was conducted to compare income and other livelihood benefits of landholders residing inside and outside the biodiversity corridors. Findings revealed that landowners within the corridors earned significantly higher incomes (USD 412/ha/year) primarily from PFES payments for watershed protection and participation in restoration activities, while those outside earned less (USD 330/ha/year) from afforestation (Acacia plantations) and forest product harvesting. Households inside corridors also reported greater access to livelihood support, improved forest governance, and higher participation in community‐based forest management.

Doherty,"Abstract Tree hollows are a critical habitat resource for a vast array of vertebrate species globally; in Australia, they are used by over 300 species of birds, mammals, and reptiles. The decline of hollow‐bearing trees due to disturbances like shifting fire regimes has prompted the use of nest boxes as a key conservation intervention. However, despite their widespread application, the efficacy of nest boxes in supporting arboreal mammals, especially in post‐fire environments, is not well established. Following the 2019–2020 megafires in Australia, our field experiment evaluated the effectiveness of nest boxes in supporting arboreal mammal recovery. We deployed six nest boxes at each of nine sites (54 in total), including six burnt and three unburnt sites, and compared arboreal mammal activity at these sites with activity at equivalent control sites, which had no nest boxes (six burnt and three unburnt sites). We used baited camera traps to survey arboreal mammal activity 2 months prior to nest box deployment and 24 months post‐deployment. We also assessed nest box occupancy by physically checking the boxes, and with camera traps, over 2 years. Nest box cameras showed that boxes were visited as early as 1 month post‐deployment, but occupancy was low when nest boxes were first physically checked at 9 months post‐deployment (17% in unburnt sites, 0% in burnt sites). At 24 months post‐deployment, mean nest box occupancy was 50% in unburnt sites and 61% in burnt sites. The population surveys using baited camera traps revealed a stronger increase in arboreal mammal activity over time at burnt sites without nest boxes compared to those with nest boxes. Conversely, in unburnt sites, activity was steady over time in control sites but increased at nest box sites. Our findings suggest that while nest boxes provided minimal benefit for arboreal mammals within burnt sites, they may benefit populations in adjacent unburnt areas.",,0.74,0.85,,,,Applied conservation experiment evaluating nest boxes for post-fire mammal recovery informs management but lacks explicit decision optimization or cost/trade-off modeling.,,False,0,10.1111/csp2.70202

Among the methods used to control nonpoint-source pollution, small water bodies such as ditches and ponds have received increasing attention due to their widespread distribution and low cost. However, most previous studies have focused on specific regions, and the key factors regulating phosphorus retention and their generalizable patterns remain unclear. Additionally, research on the synthesis of global water-body nutrient retention is largely limited to studies from North America and Europe. Here, we compiled a phosphorus retention dataset for small water bodies across China that incorporates research published in Chinese. Using multiple statistical analyses to assess the hydrological processes and external influencing factors on phosphorus removal rate and efficiency, our results show that the median total phosphorus removal rate in ditches and ponds across China was 33.7%. Among all hydrological and external influencing factors, hydraulic retention time (HRT) served as a pivotal parameter in the modulation of phosphorus removal efficiency. Extending HRT is an effective method to enhance phosphorus retention in water bodies, although it also demonstrates diminishing marginal returns. By regulating the HRT of small water bodies, a win–win situation with both pollutant reduction and agricultural production may be achieved, thereby enhancing the resilience of agricultural ecosystems to climate change. This study provides a scientific basis and technical support for achieving the dual goals of sustainable agricultural development and environmental improvement in developing countries—particularly in rice-producing regions.",,0.68,0.9,,,,Study identifies hydrological controls (HRT) to reduce agricultural phosphorus pollution with clear management implications but no explicit decision optimization or budgeting.,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3e00

Efforts to counter anthropogenic pressures on Amazonian ecosystems have largely excluded freshwater ecosystems despite their central role in supporting biodiversity and human communities. Nature based Solutions (NbS) are garnering attention as a holistic strategy that address ecological and human dimensions of resilience, offering a promising approach to couple freshwater biodiversity conservation and equitable adaptation in the Amazon. The extent to which NbS projects in the Amazon are incorporating freshwater biodiversity objectives and aligning with principles of equitable adaptation is unresolved. Synthesizing across existing NbS cases is key to distilling lessons learned and identifying remaining gaps to inform current and future project implementation. We evaluate five cases of implemented NbS projects in the lowland Amazonian basin to assess three themes: freshwater biodiversity impacts, equity considerations, and guiding policies of each case. Freshwater biodiversity outcomes are evaluated by assessing against Couto et al., 2024’ five themes for freshwater biodiversity conservation; equity implications evaluated by comparing project documents to the Stockholm Environment Institute’s Principles for Just and Equitable NbS; and the degree to which freshwater biodiversity is prioritized by relevant policies is assessed through a search for keywords. The case studies demonstrate alignment with principles of equitable and just NbS in the Amazon basin, but links to freshwater biodiversity are minimal, suggesting an oversight of the importance of sustaining and protecting freshwater biodiversity, particularly among vulnerable local communities.

While hard engineering structures (e.g. levees, seawalls) remain widely used, they can be costly, ecologically disruptive, and may exacerbate hazard complexity. Nature-based solutions (NbS), including mangroves, salt marshes, and other coastal ecosystems, offer sustainable and often cost-effective alternatives or complementarities that can mitigate hazards while delivering ecological and societal co-benefits. However, their effectiveness is difficult to assess due to diverse methodological approaches, site-specific coastal dynamics, and inconsistent reporting indicators. This study synthesises the scientific evidence base on the effectiveness of NbS in reducing hydrometeorological hazards in coastal and deltaic environments and evaluates the robustness of methods used to assess their performance. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 383 peer-reviewed English-language articles published between 2008 and 2024 was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocols and the PICO framework. Using an evaluation approach adapted from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, each study was assessed for evidence robustness, level of agreement, and overall confidence. The meta-analysis provides quantitative estimates of NbS effectiveness and highlights substantial uncertainties arising from ecological variability, methodological inconsistencies, and heterogeneity in hazard indicators (e.g. wave height, flow velocity, water level, temperature) and measurement units. Findings show that NbS effectiveness is highly context dependent and influenced by site characteristics, ecological dimensions, system configuration, and hazard intensity. The study emphasises the need for standardised, hazard-specific indicators and greater use of integrated methodological approaches to strengthen the reliability and comparability of future assessments. It also identifies opportunities for advancing hybrid or nature-positive engineering solutions that combine NbS with conventional infrastructure to enhance coastal resilience.",,0.62,0.8,,,,Systematic review/meta-analysis on coastal NbS effectiveness informs hazard mitigation and planning but lacks explicit conservation decision optimization or budget trade-offs.,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3d4d

Vegetation water content (VWC) has been proposed as a holistic indicator of entire plant water status and ecosystem functioning. However, few studies have explored its relationships with ecological and environmental factors, especially in data-scarce regions like Patagonia. In this study, we used the SMAP dataset to analyzed VWC patterns across vegetation types, landscapes, and climate anomalies over the 2015–2016 to 2024–2025 growing seasons in Southern Patagonia, covering Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego provinces. The results show that VWC varies significantly among vegetation types. Forests and shrublands generally had higher VWC than grasslands. Among them, Nothofagus betuloides and evergreen mixed forests (NB) exhibited the highest VWC, with grasslands and dry shrublands being at the lowest level. Distinct seasonal VWC dynamics emerged along landscape gradients: a bell-shaped pattern in humid areas and an inverted bell-shaped pattern in arid ecosystems, primarily driven by winter snowmelt recharge and subsequent summer water stress. VWC responded differentially to El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode phases, with El Niño and La Niña exerting contrasting effects by province. To bridge science and application, we propose incorporating these metrics into adaptive management, specifically for: (i) defining conservation-priority zones for harvesting in water-limited forests, (ii) implementing dynamic fire risk thresholds based on seasonal depletion patterns, and (iii) adjusting silvopastoral stocking rates according to inter-annual VWC trends. These findings demonstrate that VWC is a robust indicator for guiding sustainable ecosystem management and conservation planning in Southern Patagonia.",,0.69,0.8,,,,Remote-sensing analysis of vegetation water content with proposed adaptive management applications aids conservation planning but lacks formal decision or cost-effectiveness modeling.,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3b56

In the Dutch Southwest Delta, coastal management has turned tidal waters into marine lakes. The ensuing stagnation and stratification in combination with eutrophication has caused a decline in water quality, including decreased oxygen (O 2 ) saturation. Restoring such systems is challenging as exemplified by Lake Veere, which was reconnected to the tidal marine Eastern Scheldt, via a culvert, two decades ago. After an initial improvement, water quality strongly declined again in recent years. Here, we investigate the consequences of the restoration effort on coastal deoxygenation by leveraging existing monitoring data of oxygen, temperature, salinity, and benthic macroinvertebrates. In addition, we quantified the O 2 demand of the sediment at selected sites via field measurements. Water quality monitoring data indicate that the restored tidal influence resulted in strong improvements in O 2 saturation of bottom waters. However, improvements were confined to the eastern part nearby the inflow of marine water. Modelled bottom water O 2 concentrations and observed benthic macroinvertebrate densities are related, and show reduced densities under low-O 2 , especially for less mobile infauna. This highlights the detrimental effect of deoxygenation on benthic faunal communities. Geochemical analyses reveal a very high sedimentary O 2 demand, mainly caused by high concentrations of the reduced solutes ammonium and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S). These solutes are toxic and are formed by anaerobic (re)mineralization of organic matter. Furthermore, low availability of easily reducible iron-oxides in the lake sediments mutes the formation of iron-sulphides, explaining high porewater H 2 S concentrations, and release of H 2 S into bottom waters. Combined, our results illustrate the challenge of restoring a coastal ecosystem by increasing lateral oxygen supply without addressing the legacy effects of eutrophication in the sediments, reemphasizing the importance of nutrient reductions in restoration strategies.",,0.66,0.7,,,,"Empirical assessment of coastal restoration constraints offers management insights (nutrient reductions) but lacks explicit decision frameworks, costs, or optimization.",,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae38fa

We tested this hypothesis using above-ground biomass trends from 2017-2024 across Spain, a region experiencing intensifying drought and extreme events as well as increasing wildfire pressure. Using statistical matching techniques that control for initial biomass conditions and climate exposure, we compared biomass carbon conservation performance between PAs and non-PAs. PAs significantly outperformed non-PA counterparts, showing better biomass carbon conservation in 70% of biomass-matched comparisons and maintaining this advantage in 59% of climate-controlled comparisons—representing a statistically significant 9% advantage over the null hypothesis. We find that most strict PAs (National Parks) have an enhanced effectiveness, showing better performance in carbon conservation in 85% of biomass-controlled and 68% of climate-controlled matches, respectively. This advantage demonstrates that protection status itself, not merely favorable location, can drive enhanced carbon conservation.

Gurnell; John Gurnell,"This preliminary study examines how beaver engineering affects river condition in England and can be measured in relation to Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) using the River Condition Assessment (RCA) methodology. Paired river reaches with (impact) and without (control) beaver engineering were compared at eight sites across southern England. At two sites, beavers were enclosed; at six, they were free-living. Two additional sites supported free-living beavers but without beaver engineering, so impact and control reaches could not be distinguished. Three hypotheses were tested: (i) in lowland English rivers, beaver engineering improves river condition as measured by the RCA; (ii) the magnitude of improvement depends on baseline river condition; and (iii) improvements in river condition are linked to increases in the presence and abundance of specific physical habitats. Findings from paired sites indicated that beaver-engineered reaches were generally assessed by the RCA to be in better condition than control reaches, supporting hypothesis (i), especially where control reaches were assessed to be overdeep (due to past management). Furthermore, the degree to which condition improved across paired reaches was inversely related to the condition of the control reach, supporting hypothesis (ii). Ten physical features showed significantly higher abundances in beaver-impacted reaches, while other physical features showed similar abundances in control and impact reaches, supporting hypothesis (iii). Although conducted in lowland, predominantly pastoral landscapes, the sites captured a typical range of environmental settings for beaver engineering and this preliminary study demonstrates that the RCA can effectively measure the influence of beaver engineering on river condition.

York,"Abstract As biocultural approaches to conservation gain traction (e.g., through international commitments to Indigenous Peoples and local communities) and external conservation actors increasingly seek to engage with on‐the‐ground holders of biocultural diversity, improved understanding is needed of what biocultural diversity means. Building on the foundation provided by Bridgewater and Rotherham, I appraised how biocultural diversity conservation has been framed and critiqued in the academic literature based on a thematic analysis of 95 papers. Biocultural diversity was understood through the concepts of biocultural diversity hotspots; Indigenous and local knowledge; cultural landscapes; the roles and rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities; biocultural identity; and urban people–nature interactions. Four criticisms of the concept were identified, including a focus on conserving tradition, risk of overgeneralization, neglect of biocultural conflicts, and a lack of attention to power dynamics. A political ecology perspective on biocultural diversity could help address these criticisms by encouraging external conservation actors to reflect on specific questions about power when engaging with holders of biocultural diversity. If external conservation actors are willing to engage in this reflexive practice, for example, by following the prompts I devised (e.g., What preconceptions do external actors hold about culture and identity in this context? Are external actors expecting people to live or behave traditionally? Do Indigenous Peoples and local communities have decision‐making power?), commitments to conserving biocultural diversity could achieve global biodiversity goals while upholding social and environmental justice principles.",api,0.64,0.8,,,,Review of biocultural diversity conservation framings and critiques offers qualitative guidance for conservation actors without optimization.,,False,0,10.1111/cobi.70131

However, realizing the full potential that tracking holds for conservation involves understanding what has been performed on shorebirds to date and identifying regional and taxonomic knowledge gaps. To this end, we reviewed the literature on 195 species across 10 shorebird families. We determined the number of shorebird tracking studies published over time, types of tracking devices used, reporting rates for data archiving in online repositories, and coverage of the major flyways by the data collected. Using Movebank, we further identified tracked species that have not appeared in the literature. We included 351 peer‐reviewed publications in the review. Tracking data were lacking for 50% of the species reviewed. Considerably more tracking studies were conducted in temperate regions and in flyways that include wealthy countries than in the tropics. Of the 351 publications, 26.9% reported data were archived in an online repository, although the annual rate increased over time.

One reason for this discrepancy may be the lack of a coherent evidence base on how best to support the contributions of IP&amp;LC to conservation. Enabling conditions are often discussed in conservation policy, but the diverse factors that may enable or disable Indigenous and community conservation are frequently not considered in empirical studies of conservation outcomes. We explored the enabling conditions and ecological outcomes of conservation that are measured or reported in the literature on forested lands held by IP&amp;LC and identified gaps and biases in the current knowledge base. We searched 3 bibliographic databases and screened the results for relevance against predefined inclusion criteria, reviewing 182 articles. Articles examined the effects of 20 enabling conditions on 11 ecological outcomes. The more frequently explored links were between the enabling conditions—governance and law and policy—and the outcomes—forest cover and forest quality. Key knowledge gaps were the impacts of enabling conditions on species‐level outcomes and certain ecosystem services, such as soil and water quality and carbon sequestration.

Robust wildlife health surveillance can help address these risks. However, capacity and resource constraints hinder effective wildlife health surveillance at regional and national scales, particularly in lower‐ and middle‐income countries. We examined how collaboration between Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IPLCs) and wildlife health professionals may support the identification and mitigation of animal and zoonotic disease risks in remote and rural areas where wildlife surveillance remains underresourced. In the pastoral rangelands of Laikipia, Kenya, we completed interviews, focus group discussions, and elicitation methods from April 2023 to May 2024 to determine how Maasai pastoralists ( n = 57) and trained animal health professionals ( n = 10) understood wildlife health. Pastoralists held extensive place‐based knowledge of wildlife health and disease, including knowledge of clinical symptoms, species affected, transmission routes, and trends that complemented, deepened, and extended the same knowledge held by trained animal health professionals. Our results suggest that combining IPLCs’ and animal health professionals’ knowledge can benefit wildlife health surveillance by enhancing surveillance efforts, furthering mutual learning about emerging or reemerging disease, providing new understanding of disease dynamics, and, more broadly, decolonizing conservation knowledge. Two practical ways IPLCs’ knowledge could be included and availed to strengthen wildlife health surveillance and research include use of community‐led wildlife health surveillance and research and incorporation of ethnoveterinary training in formal wildlife veterinary curricula.

To evaluate the risk of such threats, species’ vulnerability to each threat must first be determined. We build on the existing threats classification scheme and ranking system of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species by assessing the vulnerability of 256 marine megafauna species to 23 at‐sea threats. The threats we considered included individual fishing gear types, climate‐change‐related subthreats not previously assessed, and threats associated with coastal impacts and maritime disturbances. Our ratings resulted in 70 species having high vulnerability ( v &gt; 0.778 out of 1) to at least 1 threat, primarily drifting longlines, temperature extremes, or fixed gear. These 3 threats were also considered to have the most severe effects (i.e., steepest population declines). Overall, temperature extremes and plastics and other solid waste were rated as affecting the largest proportion of populations. Penguins, pinnipeds, and polar bears had the highest vulnerability to temperature extremes. Bony fishes had the highest vulnerability to drifting longlines and plastics and other solid waste; pelagic cetaceans to 4 maritime disturbance threats; elasmobranchs to 5 fishing threats; and flying birds to drifting longlines and 2 maritime disturbance threats. Sirenians and turtles had the highest vulnerability to at least one threat from all 4 categories. Despite not necessarily having severe effects for most taxonomic groups, temperature extremes were rated among the top threats for all taxa except bony fishes.

Use of best handling and rapid release practices on purse seine vessels can substantially reduce mortality and improve vulnerability status for mobulids. However, interventions must be effective, operationally feasible, and safe for human operators if they are to be successfully implemented at a large scale. We assessed the feasibility and efficacy of an innovative mobulid bycatch release device (sorting grid) in collaboration with captains and crew of vessels in the tropical tuna purse seine fleet. We evaluated the size of individuals and duration of release when the sorting grid was used and compared these metrics with other release methods. Forty‐one mobulid capture events occurred on 12 vessels. Mobulids released using the sorting grid were significantly larger than those released by other methods; yet, mean handling time remained short (∼3 min), suggesting that the device enables the rapid release of even the largest individuals. Widespread implementation and use of the mobulid sorting grid could help achieve conservation goals for threatened mobulid rays and may have broader bycatch reduction benefits. Adoption of sorting grid requirements by regional fisheries management organizations could standardize best practices and markedly improve the survival of released mobulid rays globally.",api,0.68,0.8,,,,"Evaluates a practical bycatch-release device for mobulids with evidence on feasibility and effectiveness, informing fisheries management without formal optimization.",,False,0,10.1111/cobi.70150

Conservation measures including restoration are presently of great interest and focus on both historical and novel methodologies. Of paramount importance for these efforts is an understanding of the mechanics of kelp decline to identify the factors and triggers leading to stepwise declines and thus support the development and spatial prioritization of strategic intervention to facilitate resilience. Here, we utilized a unique dataset documenting the demographic dynamics of giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera , in response to multiple disturbances across &gt;40 years off San Diego (California, USA). The recruitment and life history of &gt;14,000 individuals were used to evaluate cohort structure, size, and longevity forced by algal community structure and disturbance. Cohort dynamics varied spatially by depth and study subregion, thus aiding identification of areas to prioritize intervention to foster resilience. Five algal assemblages were characterized providing context for cohort dynamics in response to physical disturbances and sea urchin grazing. A trend of decreasing cohort size and resilience was observed over time accentuated by the marine heat wave of 2014–2015 (MHW) after which competition with understory canopies increasingly interfered with giant kelp cohort development and plant size structure. Cohort recruitment ranged on a continuum from discrete (“pulsed”) to more gradual (“trickled”) episodes. Pulsed cohorts mainly produced single cohort‐dominated age stands punctuated by major disturbances. Pulsed events were more common than trickled recruitment, especially at deeper sites. Trickled cohorts resulted in relatively mixed age stands, especially when individual cohorts overlapped within sites. Trickled recruitment increased over time as understory dominance increased. Cohort longevity was highly variable among sites and among cohorts within a site, with high first‐year mortality mostly due to warming, waves, or their combination. Longevity was inversely related to temperature and sea urchin density, and was greatest at deeper sites, especially after the MHW. The downward trend of single cohort dominance and individual plant size over time and its step downward after the MHW suggest that deeper areas should be prioritized for restoration. Regardless, understory canopies will increasingly dominate Southern California with continued warming.",,0.65,0.9,,,,Long-term kelp cohort analysis offers guidance on prioritizing restoration areas and resilience planning but lacks explicit decision optimization.,,False,0,10.1002/eap.70181

Starzomski; Jason T. Fisher,"Abstract Understanding how anthropogenic disturbances compound with natural stressors to influence wildlife survival, particularly during vulnerable life stages, is critical for conserving biodiversity and informing management decisions. Juveniles can be sensitive to disturbances, which possibly reduce their survival and lead to population declines. We monitored survival of 180 juvenile moose Alces alces from capture (7–8 months old) to recruitment at 18 months old in two anthropogenically disturbed systems in western Canada, where population declines coincided with extensive salvage logging following an insect outbreak. We investigated how juvenile use of forest harvest features influenced their mortality risk, and whether this risk was modified by body condition, long‐term use of forest harvest features, forage availability, weather or predation risk from wolves Canis lupus and black bears Ursus americanus . Juvenile survivorship was 0.59 (95% CI = 0.51–0.67). Wolf predation accounted for 55.1% of mortalities, followed by bears (14.5%), humans (14.5%), health‐related (10.1%) and cougars ( Puma concolor ) (5.8%). Juvenile moose use of forest harvest features—new cutblocks (0–8 years since harvest; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.02–1.64) and higher road densities (HR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06–1.95)—reduced their survival, presumably from increased predator and hunter efficiency in these habitats. Older cutblocks did not impact juvenile survival (HR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.69–1.09). Forest harvest appears inherently risky, regardless of predation risk, forage, weather, juvenile condition and long‐term use. However, juveniles with more winter ticks, Dermacentor albipictus (HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08–1.73), and yearlings with lower weights at capture (HR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.18–0.61) had heightened mortality risk, likely from increased vulnerability to predation. Synthesis and applications . Anthropogenic disturbances, such as forest harvest, create risky landscapes for juveniles by increasing their vulnerability to predation and hunting, and when combined with natural stressors like parasitism, likely drive population declines. Managing landscapes with a species‐centric approach that addresses the cumulative effects of human and natural stressors is essential to mitigate adverse impacts from resource extraction and support wildlife populations.",,0.7,0.95,,,,Survival analysis shows compounded effects of forest harvest and natural stressors on juvenile moose with management implications but no explicit decision framework.,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70293

Conserving important open habitats and the animal species that rely on them will require management interventions to reduce tree encroachment and to maintain open vegetation. Effectiveness of interventions will depend on knowledge of how species respond to the spatial and temporal configuration of treatments. Here, we assess short‐term (5 years) responses of open habitat birds of conservation concern to mosaics of cutting and prescribed burning in a Mediterranean heathland Natura 2000 Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and Special Protection Area (SPA). In the Pratomagno SAC (central Italy), vegetation structural characteristics and open habitat birds were surveyed from pre‐treatment (only vegetation) to up to 4 years post‐treatment. Birds were monitored each spring along fixed transects (7 reference, 19 treatment). First, we compared post‐treatment trajectories of vegetation structure among treatment types. Then, we built non‐linear mixed‐effects models to assess changes in the abundance of singing individuals of open habitat birds (1) over time in treatment and reference areas; and (2) in response to the extent of treated vegetation within three age categories (&lt;1 year, 1 year and &gt;1 year since treatment). Within 4 years of treatment, shrubby vegetation was regenerating on a trajectory towards that of untreated vegetation and reduced tree height was reduced. Abundance of the Dartford warbler (Natura 2000 target species) and cirl bunting declined significantly over time in control but not reference areas. Total abundance and that of the Dartford warbler, Moltoni's warbler and common stonechat declined significantly in response to the extent of vegetation &lt;1 year since treatment, but not the extent of older age classes. The woodlark (also target species) and cirl bunting showed non‐significant positive trends to the extent of vegetation &gt;1 year and &lt;1 year since treatment, respectively. Synthesis and applications. Initial responses of open habitat birds indicate that mechanical cutting and prescribed burning in heathlands can maintain habitat to support open habitat bird species when applied in a mosaic approach. Vegetation treatments that resemble historic disturbance regimes (spatially and temporally staggered small‐scale interventions) are recommended to regenerate vegetation, reduce tree encroachment and provide habitat for declining birds.

S. van Beeck Calkoen; Walter Di Nicola; Christian Smit; Dries P. J. Kuijper; Marco Heurich,"Abstract Intensive ungulate browsing represents a major challenge for managing temperate forests, and only a clear understanding of the underlying ecological processes can help to mitigate its impact. Predator–prey interactions play a crucial role in shaping browsing patterns; however, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of these dynamics hinders the development of functional policies. Using an experimental approach, we simulated large‐carnivore presence using olfactory cues to examine the effects of predation risk on deer behaviour and its consequences for browsing intensity on tree saplings. We conducted this experiment in 11 locations in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany), each comprising four plots with olfactory cues of wolf, lynx, cow and water (control). In each plot, we planted 30 saplings representing the five most common tree species in the area, which we regularly monitored to assess browsing intensity and selectivity. In addition, we set a camera trap at each plot to record deer species (red and roe deer), age, sex and behavioural metrics like time spent vigilant, visitation duration and visitation frequency. This experimental design allowed comparisons of the effects of different large carnivore on prey species while measuring browsing intensity. Our results demonstrated that deer modified their behaviour in response to large carnivore scent cues compared to non‐risky cues, with more pronounced effects in lynx treatments compared to controls. Red and roe deer spent significantly less time in lynx treatments compared to controls, especially at dawn and dusk. In spring at dusk, we observed similar decreases in visitation duration in wolf treatments. Notably, our findings also show increased vigilance time of adult deer accompanied by juveniles at sites with lynx cues during winter nights. As a consequence of these behavioural changes, we recorded a significant reduction in browsing intensity in lynx treatments compared to controls. However, no signs of tree species selectivity were found in plots with large carnivores scent cues nor differences in visitation frequency. Synthesis and applications . By analysing multiple behavioural responses and considering relationships between different trophic guilds, we provide unique insights into the mechanisms of predator–prey interactions and their indirect impact on forest ecosystems. In particular, our findings highlight the role of large carnivores in mitigating ungulate browsing damages, which is important for managing temperate forests (both natural and commercial) where herbivore browsing is a significant pressure.",,0.65,0.85,,,,Experimental evidence that predator scent cues reduce deer browsing informs forest management but lacks explicit decision modeling or optimization.,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70267

While cities can support considerable biological richness—including rare and endangered species—the persistence of plant populations in urban habitats is often at risk. Identifying and prioritizing threats to endangered plants is essential for guiding effective conservation strategies. We analysed a unique dataset derived from expert assessments of threats to 1231 populations of 201 endangered species within Berlin's Flora Protection Programme. Threats were categorized and their relative importance quantified at both population and species levels, and across habitat types. Biotic threats were most prevalent—affecting 63% of populations and 78% of species, followed by threats related to agriculture, nutrient inputs, urban development and recreation. Among biotic threats, succession and expansive plant species were similarly important, each affecting 23%–25% of populations, followed by tree and shrub plantings (11.5%). Native species (primarily Calamagrostis epigejos and Phragmites australis ) threatened 16% of populations while non‐native species (mainly Solidago taxa and Prunus serotina ) affected 15.2%. The relevance of non‐native threats varied across habitat types, with woodlands hosting the largest number of affected populations. Despite Berlin's status as an invasion hotspot, non‐native species represented a comparatively minor threat relative to other biotic drivers, agriculture and nutrient inputs—consistently across major habitat types. Notably, no EU‐listed Invasive Alien Species were identified as threats to the target taxa—including the widespread Ailanthus altissima . Synthesis and applications. This first city‐wide assessment of threats to multiple populations of endangered plant species provides a foundation for targeted threat management in urban contexts. Maintaining habitat quality and optimizing land use will be most effective in protecting endangered species from competitive pressures. While existing non‐native threats should be addressed, their limited role suggests that urban conservation efforts should prioritize more pressing drivers of decline. In Berlin, many endangered native species likely co‐exist with non‐native species at broader spatial scales. Future studies should move beyond isolated assessment of invasion risks, compare the relative importance of different threats and apply this framework across cities in diverse biogeographical and socio‐economic settings.",,0.7,0.9,,,,City-wide threat assessment for endangered plants provides actionable management priorities but lacks explicit decision optimization or budgets.,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70275

Fraterrigo,"Abstract Feedbacks between fire and non‐native grasses can lead to a grass‐fire cycle that intensifies grass invasion and harms native trees. However, higher fire activity may reshape fire–grass–tree interactions by altering resource availability and reducing fire intensity. Understanding these dynamics and their effects on tree regeneration is critically important for maintaining and restoring declining oak populations in temperate deciduous forests. Here, we performed a landscape‐scale field experiment in oak‐hickory forests of the U.S. central hardwood region to determine how grass invasion and variation in fire activity alter post‐fire regeneration of oak seedlings and juveniles. We applied fire to outplanted white oak ( Quercus alba ) and black oak ( Q. velutina ) seedlings and naturally colonized juveniles in plots arrayed along a historical fire occurrence gradient that were either uninvaded or invaded by a widespread non‐native grass ( Microstegium vimineum ). We found that increased fire occurrence elevated light availability, with plots burnt five times receiving on average 2.5 times more light. Increased fire occurrence also reduced fire intensity, with each additional burn lowering the maximum temperature of experimental fires by 18°C. These changes contributed to post‐fire oak survival rates being almost twice as high in plots burnt five times compared with those with a history of a single prior burn. In contrast, Microstegium invasion decreased fire intensity and had no effect on post‐fire oak seedling survival in plots with a history of multiple burns. Microstegium cover also declined as fire occurrence increased. Synthesis and applications . These results suggest that recurring fire can mitigate the negative effects of grass invasion and create conditions more favourable for early oak regeneration in temperate deciduous forests.",,0.7,0.9,,,,Experimental study links fire regimes to oak regeneration and invasive grass feedbacks with management implications but no formal decision framework.,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70279

Patterson; Stuart Bearhop; Jessica M. Shaw; Geoff M. Hilton; Aimée L. S. McIntosh,"Abstract Human encroachment into the natural environment through agricultural expansion has intensified human–wildlife interactions. Negative population impacts are regularly associated with this encroachment; however, some species, including geese, benefit from novel resources these modified environments provide, often resulting in conflict with local stakeholders. Shooting management to reduce populations and/or alter distribution by manipulating the fear landscape is a common approach to mitigate conflicts. However, the efficacy of these strategies in driving redistributions is often unclear. Greenland barnacle geese ( Branta leucopsis ) wintering on Islay, Scotland have been subject to shooting management to mitigate their effect on farm pastures. We evaluated the effectiveness of this strategy in influencing field use and abundance at an island‐wide scale. Using a unique long‐term data set (2005–2019) of goose distribution and shooting activity, we assessed within‐winter drivers of foraging distribution within improved grassland in relation to habitat variability and shooting disturbance. We found field use was predominantly associated with forage acquisition at a field‐scale and low‐intensity shooting disturbance had no observed effect on abundance. Foraging was likely prioritised and has a stronger influence than disturbance, though geese did preferentially forage on perceived ‘safer’ fields (close to roosts, further from roads). Consequently, the impacts on redistribution were more marginal. Synthesis and Applications . Our results demonstrate that to be effective in stimulating redistribution, an understanding of the drivers of site use is crucial for shooting‐based disturbance regimes. We emphasise the importance of providing refuges to encourage site use and highlight the importance of considering the spatio‐temporal coordination of shooting disturbance to stimulate distributional shifts.",,0.66,0.85,,,,Evaluates efficacy of shooting disturbance on goose distribution with management recommendations but no quantitative decision optimization.,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70265

Within the greater Himalayas, Pakistan holds special significance as the north of the country represents a confluence of three major mountain ranges (Hindu Kush, Pamir–Karakoram, and Himalaya). However, robustly surveying and monitoring elusive, low‐density species such as snow leopards has historically been difficult in the region. As a result, our understanding of the spatial patterns in density and overall population size of snow leopards has remained conjectural in Pakistan. This lack of objective information is an obstacle to realizing effective conservation planning for the species in Pakistan, as well as the broader ecosystem within which it plays a key role. This study aimed to empirically derive population estimates for snow leopards in Pakistan, based on extensive camera trapping conducted over a decade (2010–2019), covering about 39% of the species' range across four major mountain ranges in northern Pakistan. A total of 828 cameras were placed over 26 540 trap days, resulting in 4712 photos of snow leopards obtained from 65 different locations. Among the 53 unique individuals identified, the majority (53%) were detected only once, with an overall recapture frequency of 2.28 times per individual. Spatial capture–recapture (SCR) was employed for population and density estimation. Model selection strongly favored a model in which density was negatively associated with distance to the closest glacier and positively associated with elevation, and baseline encounter rates were higher in the Pamir–Karakoram region and with Reconyx cameras than in other regions and types of cameras. The estimated population size for snow leopards in Pakistan was 155 (95% CI 100–239), with a mean density of 0.16 (95% CI 0.10–0.24) animals per 100 km 2 . This research provides the first robust population estimate for snow leopards in this region, establishing a foundation for long‐term population monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of conservation measures.

A vast range of studies have illustrated the potential for local ecological recovery, but its efficacy at large spatial scales remains highly uncertain. Until now, the lack of standardized biodiversity monitoring systems has restricted our capacity to evaluate the potential for ecological recovery at large spatial scales. Here, we use an ecoacoustic dataset from 119 locations to evaluate the biodiversity implications of large‐scale forest restoration within Costa Rica's redistributive Payment for Ecosystem Service (PES) program. Soundscapes recorded in degraded pastures were marked by significant changes in the timing and frequencies typical of mature reference forests. In contrast, we show that the acoustic patterns of restored PES sites have recovered and now resemble reference forests more closely. The age and ecological composition of naturally regenerating forests within the PES have led to more dramatic patterns of acoustic recovery (soundscapes 1.4 times more similar to reference forests than pastures) than in their monoculture plantation counterparts (1.24 times).

Forest restoration has emerged as a key strategy to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate warming. However, a standardized assessment of how different restoration methods contribute to biodiversity recovery and conservation remains lacking. Here, we present the first comprehensive comparison of tree diversity restoration and the drivers of recovery across five main reforestation methods (naturally regenerating forests, biodiverse restoration plantings, short‐ and long‐rotation tree monocultures, agroforests) relative to three reference systems (agropastoral lands, degraded and conserved forest remnants). Tree inventories were conducted in 519 plots (900 m 2 each) across two forest types (rainforest and seasonally dry forest) in the Atlantic forest of São Paulo state, Brazil, encompassing over 39,000 trees and 869 species. We found that: (1) all reforestation methods except short‐rotation monoculture plots supported tree diversity recovery. In the rainforest, conserved remnant plots maintained the highest average Shannon diversity (Hill 1 = 29 ± 14), while naturally regenerating forests and restoration plantings approached the diversity of degraded remnant plots (15 ± 5). In seasonally dry forest, biodiverse restoration plantings and agroforests reached diversity levels comparable to conserved remnants (15 ± 6). Additionally, (2) recovery was influenced by forest age, climate (water availability), soil fertility, and landscape context, though the relative importance of these factors varied by method. Climate and landscape context were more influential for recovery in naturally regenerating forests, while soil conditions played a greater role in biodiverse restoration plantings. Lastly, (3) species composition in naturally regenerating forests most closely resembled that of conserved remnants. Conversely, restoration plantings and agroforests exhibited high compositional overlap across sites, reducing overall species richness. Our findings underscore the wide variation in biodiversity outcomes among and within reforestation methods, emphasizing that goals and strategies must align with local conditions to maximize benefits in complex tropical landscapes.",,0.63,0.8,,,,Comparative evaluation of restoration methods and drivers directly informs tropical reforestation planning despite no explicit optimization.,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70721

Ecuador, located in the Andes–Amazon transition zone, hosts some of the world’s most biodiverse ecosystems. The REDD+ initiative, the main international mechanism for mitigating forest degradation, has identified six priority conservation areas in Ecuador—87% of which are in the Amazon region and distributed across three zones: northern, central, and southern. This study evaluates landscape fragmentation in REDD+ priority zones of the Ecuadorian Amazon over a 32-year period (i.e., 1990–2022) using a dual approach: statistical analysis with FRAGSTATS v4 and spatial modeling with Guidos Toolbox v2. Two land use/land cover (LULC) datasets were compared—one from Ecuador’s Ministry of the Environment and the other from the MapBiomas Ecuador initiative. Results revealed an overall increase in fragmentation, including a higher number of forest patches, greater isolation, and reduced patch size and representativeness. Spatial analysis indicated a clear fragmentation pattern along the north–south E45 highway corridor, which increasingly separates Andean and Amazonian ecosystems. The northern and southern zones were the most affected, due to increased accessibility linked to oil and mining activities, respectively. MapBiomas data more effectively captured fragmentation associated with small-scale deforestation. These findings provide a critical baseline for policymakers to design strategies aligned with REDD+ goals and to develop targeted actions to reduce forest fragmentation and deforestation in the Ecuadorian Amazon.",,0.66,0.8,,,,Landscape fragmentation assessment in REDD+ priority zones supports spatial planning and policy targeting without formal optimization.,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0342476

Edwards,"Three similarly sized, yet naturally varying, watersheds in the Lower Columbia River Basin were the focus of a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study from 2001-2024. The study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of habitat restoration on salmon and steelhead ( Oncorhynchus spp.) recovery. The intensity of restoration was planned to increase smolt abundance, but the consequences for life history diversity were not initially considered. However, the streams support diverse juvenile life histories of coho salmon ( O. kisutch ) and steelhead ( O. mykiss ), which may benefit resilience in ways that are underappreciated and potentially comparable to enhancing productivity. To further evaluate life history responses to restoration, we compared density, fork length (FL), age at outmigration, biomass, and growth (for coho only). We tested for effects of basin, restoration, and their interaction, while controlling for confounding factors such as yearly variation and density dependence. The best-supported models all included a main effect of basin, indicating that natural watershed processes produced juvenile fish populations that differed significantly from one another. Prior to any restoration, Mill Creek, the control (reference) stream, showed the highest coho density and the lowest steelhead density and biomass compared to the impact (treatment) streams. Mill Creek also produced the oldest but smallest steelhead, and smallest, slowest growing coho smolts. When the analysis identified effects of restoration (for coho density, growth, and biomass) or a restoration-by-basin interaction (for coho and steelhead FL), both treatment streams showed positive responses. While life history diversity can enhance the resilience of salmon populations, restoration projects rarely account for it. This study suggests that effective restoration can preserve life history diversity while targeting specific habitat factors and life stages that limit population recovery.",,0.68,0.85,,,,"BACI study evaluates restoration effects on salmon life histories, informing management despite no optimization component.",,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2025.1695522

Most ecological transformation research focuses on plants, but animals are likely affected by and plausibly mediate the extent, impact, and pace of transformations. In western North America, where invasive annual grasses are transforming sagebrush‐steppe ecosystems, we quantified how transformation in vegetation drives songbird community change. We hypothesized that transformation of vegetation communities via invasion alters wildlife communities by favoring generalists over specialists, albeit with extinction debts that may temporarily obscure transformations’ consequences. Although local‐scale songbird diversity increased with grass invasion, we found that this shift was accompanied by ongoing reorganization of songbird communities at larger scales (across the sagebrush biome), driven by heterogeneous impacts of invasion among species and guilds. Through our biome‐wide analysis, we were also able to identify high‐priority regions for conservation of sensitive songbird species.

Najjar; Astrid Layton; Maria Herrmann; Jose D. Fuentes,"Abstract In an era of change, the survival and adaptability of ecosystems will be tested. An optimal ecosystem would be both resistant and resilient to negative disturbance but also efficient and redundant in its growth when given positive subsidies. However, initial evidence has suggested that these properties cannot all be maximized at the same time, and so we sought to quantitatively assess whether there are fundamental trade‐offs between them at the ecosystem level. To achieve this aim, we used a 250‐m resolution NASA MODIS dataset of gross primary productivity (GPP) to monitor 145,871 tidal wetland locations across the conterminous United States every 16 days from March 2000 to December 2020. We quantified the size and duration of the perturbation events in tidal wetland GPP ( n = 13,754,386) and modeled their frequency distributions. Event sizes and recurrence intervals were exponentially distributed and event durations were closely modeled by an inverse power law. This scale‐free manner through which tidal wetlands dissipated perturbations to their GPP flux provided them with long‐term stability across a wide range of geography. We also found that a tidal wetland's positive event responses traded off between properties of efficiency and redundancy, its negative events traded off between resistance and resilience, and that all four properties were orthogonally related to one another. We then constructed a conceptual model to help understand the potential mechanism behind this four‐quadrant trade‐off. The trade‐off appeared to be driven by a feedback between the waiting time and magnitude of positive and negative events, the duration of their effects, and the environmental and physical constraints limiting an ecosystem's growth and productivity. In summary, we detail an emergent pattern of trade‐offs and constraints associated with how tidal wetland ecosystems respond to both positive and negative perturbations in carbon flux.",,0.74,0.85,,,,Empirical analysis of wetland productivity perturbations and conceptual trade-offs offers ecological insight but no explicit conservation decision or optimization component.,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70293

However, traditional theories often treat biodiversity as a static property, overlooking its dynamic nature, which is shaped by numerous ecosystem‐level processes identified since the 1950s. To address this gap, we develop a novel model framework grounded in island biogeography theory (IBT) to explore the ecosystem‐level mechanisms by which biodiversity and its dynamics influence ecosystem stability. This framework considers species diversity as a state variable, capturing its dynamical behavior driven by feedback mechanisms between species diversity, resource availability (nutrients), and the effects of diversity on multitrophic interactions within a plankton system. Specifically, our model demonstrates that phytoplankton diversity regulates the strength of plankton trophic interactions, which in turn alter plankton biomass and nutrient availability. These changes generate feedback loops that further reshape phytoplankton diversity itself. The presence of the feedback loops enhances the system's resistance to extinction: Increasing diversity promotes more efficient resource consumption when consumers face extinction risk, while declining diversity reduces resource consumption efficiency, thereby mitigating destabilization caused by consumer overgrazing. The critical role of species diversity dynamics in ecosystem stability is empirically supported by our analysis of a 30‐year phytoplankton dataset, which reveals a causal relationship between temporal variability in phytoplankton species richness and the stability of community biomass. Our findings unveil a new mechanism through which biodiversity influences ecosystem stability via ecosystem‐level processes, independently of population‐ or community‐level portfolio processes.",,0.7,0.85,,,,Theoretical and empirical work on biodiversity–stability feedbacks informs ecology but lacks a conservation decision-making or optimization framework.,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70298
41,Trap Cropping to Maximize Agricultural Yield: Balancing Land Allocation Trade‐Offs Between Main Crop Production and Effective Pest Management,,,,2.0,1.0,Natural Resource Modeling,B,applied_ecology,Matthew H. Holden,"ABSTRACT Trap cropping is a pest management strategy where a grower plants an attractive “trap crop” alongside the primary crop to divert pests away from it. We propose a simple framework for optimizing the proportion of a grower's field or greenhouse allocated to a main crop and a trap crop to maximize agricultural yield. We implement this framework using a model of pest movement governed by trap crop attractiveness, the potential yield threatened by pests, and functional relationships between yield loss and pest density drawn from the literature. Focusing on a simple case, we consider highly mobile pests that move freely across a small field or greenhouse, or within a larger field arranged in a repetitive layout (e.g. rows of trap plants). These pests are assumed to choose plants based solely on their relative attractiveness. We find that allocating 5%–20% of the landscape to trap plants is typically required to maximize yield and achieve effective pest control in the absence of pesticides. For highly attractive trap plants, growers can devote less space because they are more effective; less attractive plants are ineffective even in large numbers. Intermediate attractiveness warrants the greatest investment in trap cropping. However, the results are illustrative rather than prescriptive and could be sensitive to ecological and economic factors not included here, such as pest mortality, reproduction, spatial layout of traps, and additional costs associated with trap cropping. Despite these important caveats, the framework offers a transparent and tractable approach for exploring trade‐offs in pest management and can be extended to incorporate more complex pest behaviors, crop spatial configurations, and economic considerations.",,0.68,0.95,,,,"Optimizes trap-crop land allocation for agricultural yield, which is decision-focused but not conservation planning or biodiversity management.",,False,0,10.1111/nrm.70020

On land and in water, these human-derived foods can profoundly alter intraspecific interactions in wildlife with cascading effects on population dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Yet, despite their growing ecological relevance, the role of human food subsidies in shaping intraspecific interactions remains underexplored. We propose a novel framework that captures how key characteristics of human food subsidies—such as high abundance, predictability, increased proximity to humans and dietary composition—modify social interactions. Specifically, we discuss how individual-level changes in fitness, time allocation, movement and social choices can shape interactions and the resulting social network properties, both directly and indirectly through alterations in population size, density and composition. Finally, we outline the ecological and evolutionary consequences of these social changes, including impacts on the transmission of diseases, stress and information, as well as on selection and development. Collectively, these alterations highlight the broad social implications that intentional and unintentional human food subsidies can have for ecological and evolutionary processes in wildlife populations.",,0.65,0.9,,,,Conceptual framework on human food subsidies and wildlife social dynamics offers context without decision analysis or optimization for conservation.,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2465

Since the accuracy of these remote sensed data has not yet been assessed at the field scale, the objective of this study was to use combinations of locally measured soil moisture, evapotranspiration, crop yields and surface runoff to calibrate the Agricultural Policy/Environmental Extender (APEX) model for these variables and assess model performance. APEX parameters were calibrated for a 36-ha field in Missouri, United States, a spatial scale far smaller than those used in past multivariate calibration studies. Model performance was highest for outcomes included in the calibration process. However, the model struggled to simultaneously optimize crop yields and runoff performance, possibly due to limitations in the model's implementation of crop failure. Including soil moisture or evapotranspiration with runoff in the calibration process improved their respective performance but did not significantly change runoff performance. Calibration with evapotranspiration (excluding runoff) outperformed other non-runoff calibration combinations, implying that remotely sensed evapotranspiration data could help expand the spatial coverage of field-scale agricultural modeling in a region.

Increased loss of these once common landscape features, exacerbated by changing land use, anthropogenic habitat fragmentation, and the loss of traditional or customary practices, means that there are becoming increasing precarious habitats. We focus on the Noble Chafer ( Gnorimus nobilis ) as a species that shows a precarity of habitat that rests on complimentary landscape management choices. We use this charismatic invertebrate as a bioindicator to explore the direct impact of changes to England's orchard landscapes on biodiversity. Interviewing 30 key stakeholders involved in the management and preservation of traditional orchards, we examine the competing motivations, practices and understanding of habitat that inform their practices in maintaining traditional orchards. Human action lies at the heart of how orchard habitats were established in the past, and how they remain and are maintained in the present. However, competing approaches to orchard management and maintenance, albeit with the best intentions, challenge the maintenance of a continuity of habitat for Noble Chafer. We argue that to achieve a balance between competing landscape needs there needs to be more education and importantly a reframing of orchard practices, to raise awareness of the Noble Chafer and its habitat.

This study investigates how significant life experiences (SLEs) and environmental values (biospheric, altruistic, hedonistic, egoistic) shape conservation engagement. Methods : Using a mixed‐methods approach, qualitative interviews with German bird conservationists identified formative life experiences. A subsequent survey of 510 participants (177 conservationists, 333 laypeople) compared SLEs and values and examined their predictive role for bird conservation engagement. Group differences : Bird conservationists reported significantly more SLEs and stronger biospheric values than laypeople, whereas laypeople scored higher on hedonistic and egoistic values. Altruistic values did not differ between groups. Predictive pathways : Structural equation modelling showed that emotionally salient SLEs positively predicted biospheric and altruistic values, while experiences in structured settings were more strongly associated with bird conservation engagement. Biospheric values emerged as a key motivational driver, whereas altruistic values were unexpectedly negatively related to engagement. Implications : The findings highlight the importance of tailoring SLEs to intended outcomes: emotionally rich experiences foster intrinsic environmental values, while structured environments facilitate action.

Despite its widespread use in the scientific literature, there is a limited understanding of how the keystone concept is defined or measured, or applied in practice, and especially in aquatic systems. This paper summarizes current uses and knowledge gaps associated with different approaches to applying keystone species concepts to fish and fisheries, based on a systematic scoping review of refereed literature published over the last decade. Cultural dimensions for keystone designation have not been applied to the same extent as ecological criteria. As well, only 13% of studies reviewed applied the term ‘keystone’ to a species by testing its status in the fish and fisheries domain. In general, ecological keystone species designation generally follows a systematic framework that involves using ecosystem dynamic modelling. We recommend that keystone species designation should be explicitly described and defined and should ideally incorporate both social and ecological dimensions of an ecosystem. From a socioeconomic perspective, inclusion of economic, sustenance and historical dimensions as well as cultural significance would provide a more robust application of the keystone species concept.

Cord; Julian Wendler; Andrea Knierim,"Abstract Efforts to conserve biodiversity in agricultural landscapes across Europe remain insufficient, as biodiversity further declines. This is sometimes ascribed to conservation policy failing to address the meanings and values that farmers attribute to the social and ecological contexts shaping their decisions influencing biodiversity. Using a relational approach, we explore how farmers describe their relationships with their land, society, the landscapes they inhabit and the values associated with these relationships. By drawing on the literature dealing with relational values and ‘good farming’, we also examine how practices that farmers identify as integrating both farming and conservation embody those values. We conducted qualitative interviews that included farm walks and an adapted photovoice activity with 15 farmers in 2022. The farmers were purposefully selected to represent diverse farming systems in Saxony, Germany. We analysed interview transcripts for relational values, while photos were clustered into categories representing practices that integrated both farming and conservation. In addition to relational values commonly mentioned in the literature, such as sense of belonging, longtermism, circularity, and autonomy, our findings suggested that frugality, reciprocity between farmers and society, holism, joy, gratitude, and humility were equally or even more important. Practices that were in line with both ‘good farming’ and ‘good conservation’ emerged as belonging to four categories: hedges and trees, diverse crop rotations, integrating animals and set‐aside fallow and flowering areas. These practices embody a range of relational values, based on farmers' individual contexts comprising their relationships with their land, landscape and society. By thinking through farmers' values and practices, researchers might support a deeper investigation to how conservation goals may be better aligned with farming in specific contexts and how they together may be used to change or uphold norms regarding ‘good land use’. Further research should explore how practices can support valued relationships between farmers, society and landscapes. With future developments in the European's Common Agricultural Policy, it will become even more important that policymakers understand which norms of land use they may be perpetuating through incentivizing certain practices and how these norms nurture farmers' relationships or not.

342,The role of trust in wildlife damage response systems: One step towards coexistence between livestock farming and large carnivores?,,,,2.0,1.0,People and Nature,B,applied_ecology,Katrina Marsden; Marion Jay; Albin Blaschka; Kari Langöen; Yorgos Mertzanis; Tasos Hovardas; Valeria Salvatori; Laura Schwarz; Liam Singer; Xenia Wietlisbach,"Abstract Wildlife damage to livestock and crops is the primary cause of conflict and a major barrier to human–wildlife coexistence across Europe and beyond. Data on such damages play a key role in understanding and shaping these conflicts. Policy responses have emphasised prevention and compensation to support extensive husbandry practices; however, these measures do not necessarily prevent conflicts, and damage management remains highly contested in some regions. Farmers' trust in the damage response system is decisive for coexistence strategies. Trust likely impacts whether affected farmers submit reliable depredation information, which is key to data validity. Trustful relations with authorities may also influence willingness to put in place livestock protection measures. Yet little is known about how choices in the damage response system affect trust. In this perspective, we argue that key pressure points impact three aspects of trust: (1) trust in institutional outcomes; (2) trust in institutional processes; and (3) interpersonal trust. Building on experience gathered in researching and implementing large carnivore management systems across the European Union (EU), and the exploration of case studies from five EU countries with contrasting wildlife governance systems and administrative processes, we discuss four aspects of the damage response system that have significant implications for trust: the role of the inspector; degree of centralisation and type of coordination; speed and predictability of response; and level of compensation. Beyond technical improvements, building trust should be a central focus of research and policy. The damage response system remains under‐examined and needs further empirical investigation and comparative work, including exploration of farmers' views. The professionalism, neutrality, and empathy of inspectors can foster positive farmer experiences and strengthen interpersonal trust in day‐to‐day wildlife management. Institutional trust can be reinforced through a well‐coordinated, fair compensation system with predictable responses within an agreed, ideally short, timeframe.

Whether such efforts are deemed successful depends on ecological and economic outcomes, with limited consideration of the social processes, costs, and benefits. This article provides a critical reflection of dominant approaches to invasive species management that frequently overlook social processes and outcomes in the setting of program goals and metrics of success. Based on our collective experience researching people's engagement with invasive species and conservation more broadly, we propose that future policy and practice need to incorporate three principles: diversity and social justice, learning from failure, and explicit acknowledgement of social relationships as management enablers.

Among the existing biogeochemical EOVs, data synthesis products—which demonstrate the immense value of data coordination—already exist for carbon-relevant data (e.g. SOCAT, Global Ocean Data Analysis Project), and for methane and nitrous oxide (MEMENTO). The roadmap for building a Global Ocean Oxygen Database and ATlas (GO 2 DAT) (Grégoire et al (2021 Front. Mar.

These functions are increasingly threatened by soil degradation, especially in climate-vulnerable regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, where unstable soils are prone to severe erosion. As soils continue to degrade, farmers face multiple challenges; they cannot afford accurate tests to assess soil, their livelihoods are constrained by demand for food, fuel and water, and competition for valuable resources hampers farming. Hence, there is a pressing need for accessible tools to assess soil health and methods to provide tailored advice on resilient, climate-smart agricultural management and optimal use of resources. This narrative review offers a comprehensive overview of key issues and potential solutions. We highlight tools and approaches that can support farmers to improve soil and secure livelihoods. Practical indicators and field-ready tests are evaluated, with examples from Ethiopia, but tailored to support farmers and advisors across sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries. A wide range of tests are reviewed, including physical, biological, chemical, function and service-related tests, drawing on scientific and farmers knowledge. Science-based tests require expertise, equipment and incur costs, while locally-derived tests are affordable and seamlessly applicable. We also review nature-based solutions for improving soil quality, and assess them against factors such as labour, costs, and crop production. There is no single universally applicable practice; suitability depends on farmers’ priorities and circumstances. Therefore, we explore predictive methods – mechanistic, process-based soil models, data- and knowledge-driven Artificial Intelligence and systems models – to simulate the impact of practices on soil and farm dynamics. Promising approaches include hybrid approaches assimilating data, physics and knowledge through digital soil mapping. Overall, this review emphasizes the need to empower farmers with accessible tools and methods to harness nature-based solutions, build climate resilience and secure sustainable futures for generations ahead.",,0.62,0.8,,,,Review of farmer-centered soil health assessment and NbS is adjacent to conservation with practical tools but not focused on biodiversity conservation decisions or optimization.,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3975

Renewable energy such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind power provides opportunities to mitigate sectoral water use, but quantifying their effects on the water-energy-land nexus remains challenging. Using an engineering-economic optimization model, this study quantifies how, and to what extent, energy transition towards PV and wind mitigates water competition between the energy and land sectors in the Yellow River Basin from 2020 to 2050. Results show that under current conditions, energy water use increases by 32.9 × 10 8 m 3 yr −1 (+34.2%) while irrigation water decreases by 23.3 × 10 8 m 3 yr −1 (−12.7%) compared to the baseline. Transitioning to PV and wind energy, alongside electricity transmission, substantially alleviates the competition. Energy water use decreases by 82.1 × 10 ⁸ m 3 yr −1 (−63.7%) across the basin, and irrigation water is replenished by 21.9 × 10 8 m 3 yr −1 (+54.7%) in Inner Mongolia and 1.6 × 10 8 m 3 yr −1 (+35.9%) in Shandong. Though costly, the transmission line from Inner Mongolia and Shandong is prioritized for reducing the local consumption of renewable energy, ensuring downstream energy supply and restoring irrigation water availability. These findings underscore the critical role of transitioning to renewable energy in resolving sectoral water conflicts, and highlight the importance of electricity transmission in balancing spatial disparities in energy and irrigation demands across the basin.",,0.75,0.8,,,,Optimizes energy–water trade-offs in a river basin but is not tied to biodiversity conservation or protected area decisions.,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3784

The National Energy Strategy 2022-2030 forecasts an additional 2302 MW capacity increase. This study develops a spatial suitability model for wind farm siting using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) combined with GIS-based analysis. Eight criteria were evaluated and weighted based on expert judgment. Factors considered include wind speed, slope, altitude, land use, distance to transmission lines, settlements, roads and protected areas. Using GIS Weighted Overlay analysis, land was classified into five suitability classes. Results show that 51.1 % of Romania's territory is suitable for wind energy projects, especially in the eastern and southeastern counties of Tulcea, Constanța, Brăila, Galați, Călăraşi, and Vaslui. Validation against existing wind farm locations showed a 69.9 % spatial match within areas classified a 'Very High' suitability, and over 80 % within the combined 'High' and 'Very High' classes.

While camera traps show potential for monitoring ground‐dwelling mammal densities, labour‐intensive data processing remains a significant constraint. Ideally, conservation efforts would benefit from the continuous monitoring of multiple species across broad spatial scales; however, the time and effort required for data processing make achieving this challenging. We developed the RAD‐REST (Random Encounter and Staying Time model Relying on All Detections) model, an extension of the Random Encounter and Staying Time model, to enable multi‐species density monitoring with substantially reduced effort. By explicitly modelling the probabilistic process of animals entering a predefined focal area, our model allows density estimation by analysing entry counts and staying times in only a subset of videos, while incorporating trapping rates from all video data. We also developed a user‐friendly R package ‘ctrest’ to implement the model's fully Bayesian framework, including estimation of activity levels. Using data from the Boso Peninsula, Japan, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to determine the number of videos required to achieve (1) standard precision for density estimation (coefficient of variation, ) and (2) more stringent wildlife management standards (). The RAD‐REST model produced unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage rate. Although the original REST model showed superior precision, RAD‐REST model achieved acceptable estimation precision with dramatically reduced analytical effort. To reach acceptable values (≤0.35) using a 200‐camera array, most species (10 of 12) required analysing only 100 videos for entry counts and measuring staying times in videos with ≥1 entry (approximately 60%–70% of analysed videos). For higher precision (), a larger 400‐camera network was necessary, requiring analysis of 7.00% (single‐species) or 6.45% (multi‐species) of total expected videos (&gt;ca. 40,000 videos). Although precise estimates might still demand substantial effort, the RAD‐REST model enables cost‐effective monitoring by either supplementing photo‐trap arrays with a subset of video data or deploying dedicated video cameras across a portion of the network. This approach marks a critical advance towards large‐scale monitoring efforts, enabling more robust, multi‐species density estimation across diverse ecological contexts.",,0.69,0.9,,,,Methods paper for camera-trap density estimation reduces processing effort and costs but is not directly a conservation decision framework.,,False,0,10.1111/2041-210x.70248

They are traditionally trained with data on direct species observations. However, if collecting species data is difficult or expensive, complementary information sources on species distributions are needed. Expert knowledge has been demonstrated to improve SDM predictions in a number of such applications but there is still no consensus on methods to integrate information from several experts into a single coherent species distribution prediction. Moreover, since expert assessments are inherently subjective and prone to biases, expert‐driven SDMs should calibrate their assessments. We propose a method to tackle these challenges by extending the hierarchical Bayesian integrated species distribution modeling framework to expert informed species distribution modeling. We treated map‐like expert assessments as data and integrated them with calibration data on species recordings. Our integrated SDM has model components to estimate experts' reliability and to adjust for potential biases in their assessments. After integrated inference, we used the model to make predictions over a study area. We tested our approach with an extensive simulation study and a real world case study comprising ten expert assessments and survey data on pikeperch larvae from a coastal area of the Gulf of Finland. Expert assessments significantly improved species distribution predictions compared to predictions conditioned on survey data only. They also improved parameter inference, thus strengthening the ecological interpretation of the results. The skill of the experts, and biases in their assessments, varied considerably in the case study though, emphasizing the importance of formal expert calibration provided by our model. Our results show that expert elicitation can be an efficient tool for improving species distribution model predictions. Our approach is especially useful for applications where any type of species data are expensive to collect but local species experts can easily be reached.",,0.73,0.9,,,,Bayesian method integrates expert elicitation into SDMs; useful for ecology/monitoring but not directly tied to conservation decision optimization.,,False,0,10.1002/ecog.08173

Results show that, although the EFs of unit mass crop production generally declined across provinces, national total EFs increased, with land, carbon, and phosphorus footprints rising by 16%, 17%, and 23%, respectively, during the study period.

Four diversity metrics (richness, evenness, Simpson index, and Shannon–Wiener index) were applied to reconstruct plant diversity. Richness declined from 11 to 9.2 ka BP, remained low and variable between 7 and 3 ka BP, and increased again after 3 ka BP. These long-term trends track regional climate change. Superimposed centennial-scale variability was early Holocene, which maintained open canopies and high biodiversity. On the contrary, low fire frequency at Storasjö promoted closed conifer forests and lower diversity. The mid-Holocene low-fire regime at Stavsåkra decreased evenness, whereas moderate fire disturbance at Storasjö sustained mixed forests. After 1 ka BP, anthropogenic fires initially enhanced diversity, but ultimately reduced it when burning became excessive. The results corroborate the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis: moderate fire frequency maximises plant diversity, whereas both low-fire regime and high-frequency burning depress it.

To support these targets, projects of common and mutual interest (PCI-PMI)—large infrastructure projects for electricity, hydrogen and CO 2 transport, and storage—have been identified by the European Commission. This study focuses on PCI-PMI projects related to hydrogen and carbon value chains, assessing their long-term system value and the impact of pipeline delays and shifting policy targets using the sector-coupled energy system model PyPSA-Eur. Our study shows that PCI-PMI projects enable a more cost-effective transition to a net-zero energy system compared to scenarios without any pipeline expansion. Hydrogen pipelines help distribute affordable green hydrogen from renewable-rich regions in the north and southwest to high-demand areas in central Europe, while CO 2 pipelines link major industrial emitters with offshore storage sites. Although these projects are not essential in 2030, they begin to significantly reduce annual system costs by more than €26 billion from 2040 onward. Delaying implementation beyond 2040 could increase system costs by up to €24.2 billion per year, depending on the extent of additional infrastructure development. Moreover, our results show that PCI-PMI projects reduce the need for excess wind and solar capacity and lower reliance on individual CO 2 removal technologies, such as direct air capture, by 13–136 Mt annually, depending on the build-out scenario.",,0.86,0.7,,,,Energy infrastructure optimization for hydrogen/CO2 pipelines is climate/energy policy-focused with no biodiversity conservation decision framing.,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3846

Despite high N deposition across China, the magnitude and drivers of N retention and contribution to forest C sequestration remain unclear due to a lack of systematic regional synthesis. Here, we synthesized data from decades of 15 N tracer experiments spanning boreal to tropical regions of China to quantify the retention of deposited N, distribution among plant and soil pools, and contribution to forest C sequestration. On average, Chinese forests retained ~65% of the deposited N, with about two‐thirds stored in the soil. Total retention and partitioning of N varied with climate, successional stage, and N forms. Soil organic layer retention declined, while mineral soil retention increased along a north–south gradient in mean annual temperature. Chronically N‐saturated and disturbed forests exhibited low plant retention, whereas other forests showed substantial uptake across climate zones. Total ecosystem retention efficiency generally declined from boreal to tropical forests. Across successional stages, retention did not differ significantly; however, primary forests retained more deposited N in mineral soils, whereas plantations favored retention in the organic layer. Stoichiometric scaling indicates that CN response (kg C sequestered per kg deposited N) varies among forest types, ranging from ~7 to 40 kg C kg −1 N, with boreal forests and plantations exhibiting the strongest C response due to greater N limitation. This suggests that over the past decade, N deposition enhanced C sequestration by approximately 0.11 Pg C year −1 , accounting for 20%–30% of China's forest C sink. Overall, these findings advance understanding of the drivers of deposited N retention and its contribution to C sequestration, with implications for predicting forest N and C dynamics under global change.",,0.66,0.8,,,,Biogeochemical synthesis on nitrogen deposition and carbon sequestration is largely ecological with minimal direct conservation decision framing.,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70724

Broitman,"Kelp forests are among the most productive and resilient coastal ecosystems, providing long-term ecological stability and diverse resources for marine and human communities. These attributes underpin the Kelp Highway Hypothesis (KHH), which proposes that kelp-dominated seascapes facilitated early human coastal dispersal and settlement along the Pacific Rim. While most KHH research has focused on the North Pacific, its southern extension remains poorly understood. Here, we apply species distribution models (SDMs) to reconstruct the potential distribution of major kelp species along the Pacific coast of South America during three key paleoclimatic periods: the Last Glacial Maximum, the Mid-Holocene, and the Medieval Warm Period. Our results reveal persistent and spatially continuous kelp habitats over millennial timescales, with evidence of poleward shifts in suitable areas following postglacial warming. When compared with published archaeological data, these reconstructions show recurrent spatial overlap between favorable kelp habitats and early coastal sites. Although direct evidence of kelp use remains scarce, this spatial congruence supports the idea that kelp forests may have provided stable and productive environments that facilitated human occupation and mobility along the southeastern Pacific coast. By integrating paleoenvironmental modeling with archaeological evidence, this study contributes a novel South American perspective to the KHH and demonstrates the potential of SDMs for reconstructing ancient coastal ecosystems within a paleoecological framework.",,0.75,0.9,,,,Paleo-distribution and archaeological analysis offers historical context with minimal direct conservation decision relevance.,,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2025.1720175

Mandaliya,"Background Bamboo is a strategic resource for poverty alleviation, rural growth, ecological restoration, sustainable jobs, and industrial innovations. The function of bamboo goes beyond conventional uses and extends to the international policy reformation toward sustainable transitions. Its alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) has been increasingly recognized. Aim This article aimed to assess bamboo for qualitative and quantitative attainment of the 169 targets of the 17 goals of the UN SDG Framework. Methodology The qualitative assessment was classified into three grades: high, medium, and low. The quantitative assessment examined the individual 169 targets on a scale of 1–10. Key findings The average percent score (APS) from the qualitative assessment of bamboo was ranked and graded for SDGs 1–17 into five major groups: group A—with APS above 50%, targets achieved (SDGs 7, 13, 1, 11, and 9); group B—with APS 40%–50%, challenges remain (SDGs 12, 6, 15, and 2); group C—with APS 30%–40%, significant challenges (SDGs 4, 5, 8, and 10); group D—with APS 15%–30%, major challenges (SDGs 17, 14, and 3); and group E—with APS below 15%, not achieved (SDG 16). Subsequently, quantitative assessment of each of the 169 UN SDG target achieved by bamboo showed that 45 targets achieved the highest scale of 8–10, 35 medium (on a scale of 4–7), 25 low (on a scale of 1–3), and 64 no connection (on a scale of 0). The highest score of 10 was shown for four targets, i.e., 8.4 (efficiency of resources and circular production), 9.2 (green industrialization, composites, and textiles), 11.6 (minimize city environmental footprint and waste), and 15.3 (land degradation neutrality through revegetation and biochar). Case studies and policy implications This article further delved into case studies on bamboo for sustainability from nine countries. Based on these case studies, we derived a seven-point policy intervention integrating the UN SDG Framework for bamboo as the green gold of ecosystems. Conclusions In a nutshell, this article could be the first of its kind to quantify the 169 targets for bamboo on a scale of 1–10.

Existing climate regulations can inadvertently support this trend, notably the attribute-based vehicle emissions standards (VES) that have less stringent requirements for larger vehicles. We utilize a model of demand and supply interactions to simulate a VES that is neutral regarding vehicle class and size, as well as a truck purchase tax and electric vehicle efficiency standard. Relative to the attribute-based version, a neutral VES can induce modest but additive reductions in GHG emissions and new vehicle mass. Additional instruments can further reduce vehicle emissions and size, and reduce battery capacity among electric vehicles. In short, careful policy design can help to reduce vehicle upsizing trends while contributing to GHG mitigation.",,0.7,0.95,,,,Transportation policy modeling for vehicle downsizing and GHG mitigation is not about biodiversity conservation or conservation decision-making.,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae41d0

A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) is one of the principal policies suggested to minimize these impacts. This study examines the implications of CBAM for the global iron and steel industry using a modified version of the Global change analysis model (GCAM). We introduce an expanded steel sector representation and a differentiated trade market to assess the impacts of CBAM implementation across OECD and non-OECD regions under deep decarbonization scenarios. Additionally, we explore the role of free emissions allowances, export rebates, and green subsidies in modifying CBAM outcomes. Our findings indicate that CBAM can reduce emissions leakage and incentivize the adoption of low-carbon steel technologies but may disadvantage exporters in regions implementing CBAM, leading to a net-loss of production in CBAM regions.

Yet, how national plans align with EU-wide ambition, alongside the implications for investment, infrastructure, and power-system operation, remain insufficiently assessed. We address this gap by linking an EU-specific implementation of a prominent integrated assessment model with Member State-level disaggregation (GCAM-Europe) with a higher-resolution European electricity system model (EXPANSE). This modelling framework captures national heterogeneity, sectoral detail, and spatiotemporal variability in electricity demand, renewable supply, and storage, enabling the assessment of grid investments and infrastructure. We analyse four scenarios representing EU-wide (Fit-for-55) or national (NECP) targets, implemented through explicit policies ( POLICY ) or cost-optimal carbon caps ( COST_OPTIMAL ). Results show all scenarios achieve the −55% fossil CO 2 reduction by 2030, with the electricity sector driving the largest chunk. Renewable energy nearly doubles, with POLICY scenarios accelerating electrification and heat pump deployment, while COST_OPTIMAL scenarios leaning more on biofuels. Efficiency targets are partially met, with POLICY scenarios distributing savings more evenly across Member States compared to concentrated reductions of COST_OPTIMAL scenarios. By 2035, power system transformation diverges strongly: COST_OPTIMAL scenarios expand ~1250 GW of new capacity, concentrated in few resource-rich regions, while POLICY scenarios reach ~1750 GW with broader spatial distribution, requiring higher investments in renewables and grids. Average wholesale electricity prices are higher and more heterogeneous under POLICY scenarios, reflecting carbon costs, transmission bottlenecks, and reliance on fossil backup.

Our analysis examines two scenarios: one reflecting implemented policies, and another adding proposed climate policies alongside electrified industrial projects, including liquefied natural gas facilities and large-scale mining operations. Results reveal dramatically different infrastructure requirements between scenarios, with the latter requiring substantially higher electricity capacity expansion, dominated by variable renewable energy and higher peak demand growth. Emissions outcomes diverge: while implemented policies deliver meaningful emissions reductions, net-zero aligned proposed policies achieve smaller overall reductions when accounting for prospective emissions from fossil fuel projects, which offset decarbonization elsewhere in the economy. Proactive energy system planning and accelerated infrastructure permitting and construction will be required to meet decarbonization and economic development goals.

We developed a data-driven framework that integrates sliding-window correlation networks, SHAP-enhanced XGBoost models, and SHAP-guided Bayesian optimization. This framework identifies key process variables and effluent-specific control targets, underscoring the need for differentiated aeration strategies rather than a single plant-wide setting. The network analysis showed that early windows had dense positive links between flow related variables such as Flow_H and Flow_F and effluent indicators, whereas later windows became sparse with many isolated nodes, indicating a weakened aeration-effluent coupling and the instability of fixed control relationships. XGBoost models for COD_out, NH<sub>3</sub>-N_out, TN_out and TP_out achieved high predictive accuracy with R<sup>2</sup> values between 0.951 and 0.998, and SHAP consistently identified Flow_H and Flow_F together with influent loads as key predictors, confirming that zone specific aeration flows are major operational levers for effluent quality. Using these interpretable models, Bayesian optimization combined with response surface analysis found that higher Flow_F minimized predicted COD and NH<sub>3</sub>-N, while phosphorus removal (TP_out) benefited from elevated Flow_H and Flow_M, underscoring the need for differentiated aeration strategies tailored to individual effluent targets rather than a single plant wide setting.

Booth; Ben P. Harvey; Sylvain Agostini; Timothy Ravasi; Ivan Nagelkerken,"Abstract Ocean warming is driving species range extensions into cooler regions. The direct physiological influence of warming on species performance can accelerate such extensions into novel ecosystems; however, indirect effects of invader–resident interactions in cooler regions may counter these positive effects. Here, we examined the foraging performance and densities of competing warm‐water and cool‐water fishes across a latitudinal temperature gradient spanning 1500 km from tropical to temperate reefs subjected to rapid ocean warming in the southern hemisphere, and across natural analogs of temperate, tropicalized, and acidified reef localities in the northern hemisphere, and during a severe marine heatwave at a temperate reef. While current levels of ocean warming have allowed the warm‐water fish to extend their ranges into temperate ecosystems at both hemispheres, their foraging performance was reduced at both the cold‐ and warm‐temperate reefs compared to the (sub)tropical reefs. However, at the (warmer) tropicalized reef, the warm‐water fish had higher foraging performance and maintained densities, even under extreme pH reduction, compared to the temperate reef. In contrast, the cool‐water species struggled at the warmer tropicalized and extreme reefs with reduced foraging performance and lower population densities compared to the temperate reef. Contrastingly, the severe heatwave experienced at the temperate reef did not alter the foraging behaviors of either species. We suggest that ocean warming boosts the foraging performance of the range‐extending warm‐water fish and impairs that of their cool‐water competitor at temperate reefs, irrespective of acidification and heatwaves, leading to a shift in dominance hierarchies on temperate reefs. We conclude that warming‐driven increases in foraging performance of the warm‐water species may alleviate foraging limitations and enhance its establishment at its leading range edges under climate change, to the detriment of its cool‐water competitors.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70226

Traditional monitoring approaches, while scientifically rigorous, are often limited by logistical, financial, and institutional constraints. While several citizen science initiatives have advanced freshwater habitat assessment in Europe (e.g., FreshWater Watch) and North America (e.g., EPA's Volunteer Monitoring Program), comparable efforts remain scarce in South America. PreserVamos contributes to filling this regional gap by providing the first large‐scale, standardized citizen‐generated dataset for aquatic ecosystems in Argentina, offering valuable opportunities for integration with global freshwater monitoring databases. “PreserVamos” is a citizen science initiative designed to collect and integrate ecological observations of rivers, lagoons, wetlands, estuaries, and streams throughout Argentina, where participants engage through a mobile application to record semiquantitative ecological indices, environmental conditions, human uses, and wildlife presence. Data are standardized through predefined survey forms and geolocated using mobile GPS. The calculated habitat index is supported by up to 25 complementary variables and a precision score estimating response reliability and is based on published riverine habitat indices for the country. To date, PreserVamos includes over 1200 observations from diverse waterbodies and biogeographic regions in the country, and an additional dataset is included with ~100 observations from other countries. Streams and rivers from the “sierras” (low mountain ranges) were among the most frequently sampled systems ( n = 312) and exhibited the highest ecological quality, with a mean index of 78.38 ± 9.45 (SD) on a scale of 0–100. Mountain streams ( n = 55) also showed high ecological scores, averaging 70.36 (±6.75). In contrast, estuaries ( n = 34) demonstrated lower ecological quality, with a mean index of 61.89 (±15.03). Lowland rivers ( n = 558), the most represented waterbody type, had a moderate mean index of 68.57 (±18.89). Lowland lagoons or lakes ( n = 228) showed lower ecological conditions, with an average score of 62.90 (±14.82). Patagonian forest lakes ( n = 29) had a high mean index of 78.34 (±11.06), while Patagonian Forest rivers ( n = 12) showed moderate conditions at 69.20 (±9.40). Patagonian steppe rivers were only represented by two observations, with a preliminary mean of 74.15 (±9.40).

Grainger,"Abstract Dispersal is becoming increasingly critical to understand as climate change forces species to shift their ranges to track changing environments. Although we know that warmer temperatures can prompt species to shift their ranges, we have little understanding of how temperature affects the speed at which they can do so by altering the rate of range expansion. Warmer temperatures could accelerate the rate of range expansion by increasing random, density‐independent movement and/or by increasing population growth rates and driving density‐dependent movement. To test the effect of temperature on the rate of range expansion, we grew populations of the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum in linear connected landscapes at 27.5, 30, or 32.5°C and tracked their expansion for 18 weeks. We then conducted separate assays to isolate the effect of temperature on density‐independent dispersal probability and population growth rates. We found that beetles at 32.5°C exhibited the fastest range expansion, and that higher temperatures increased both dispersal probability and population growth rates, suggesting that both mechanisms likely contributed to faster range expansions under warming. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing the effects of temperature on range expansion dynamics in order to fully understand how, and how quickly, ranges will shift under climate change.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70313

These data can then be analyzed to inform stakeholders and decision‐makers. One such technique is passive acoustic monitoring, which is commonly coupled with automatic identification of animal species based on their sound. Automated sound analyses usually require the training of sound detection and identification algorithms. These algorithms are based on annotated acoustic datasets which mark the occurrence of sounds of species inside sound recordings. However, compiling large annotated acoustic datasets is time‐consuming and requires experts, and therefore, they normally cover reduced spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales. This data paper presents WABAD, the World Annotated Bird Acoustic Dataset for passive acoustic monitoring. WABAD is designed to provide the public, the research community, and conservation managers with a novel and globally representative annotated acoustic dataset. This database includes 5047 min of audio files annotated to species‐level by local experts with the start and end time and the upper and lower frequencies of each identified bird vocalization in the recordings. The database has a wide taxonomic and spatial coverage, including information on 91,931 vocalizations from 1192 bird species recorded at 72 recording sites in 29 recording locations (mainly countries) and distributed across 13 biomes. WABAD can be used, for example, for developing and/or validating automatic species detection algorithms, answering ecological questions, such as assessing geographical variations on bird vocalizations, or comparing acoustic diversity indices with species‐based diversity indices.

Despite recent theoretical advances in understanding why individuals within the same population vary in dispersal behavior, relatively few studies have empirically evaluated the long‐term causes and consequences of variable dispersal within natural populations. In this study, we used life history data collected over the course of 16 years to examine fitness outcomes in 867 known‐age female tree swallows breeding in New York, USA, that differed in their dispersal status: “immigrant” females, defined as dispersers that hatched elsewhere, and “local” females, defined as non‐dispersers that hatched within the study site and returned there after migration to breed. We also compared the life history responses of immigrant and local females to natural variation in weather, nest predation risk, and social environment at their breeding site. Local females were more likely to produce fledglings that recruited into the study area as adults. We also found several instances in which dispersal status interacted with an environmental metric to influence relative fitness, and these responses were largely consistent across life history measures. Overall, immigrant females were relatively resilient to variation in their extrinsic environment, while local females were highly sensitive to environmental conditions at the breeding site, performing relatively well when conditions were benign and faring relatively poorly as conditions became more stressful. We found little evidence that distance dispersed within a study site impacted female fitness, suggesting that the dispersal‐associated differences in fitness that we observed operate mostly across broader spatial scales. Future work should undertake the direct and simultaneous measurement of behavior, physiology, and fitness of immigrant and local females across environmental contexts and should seek to understand whether and how context‐dependent fitness variation of dispersers and non‐dispersers scales up to influence larger ecological and evolutionary processes.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70299
6,A flexible model for thermal performance curves,,,,,0.0,Ecology,A,ecology,Mauricio Cruz‐Loya; Erin A. Mordecai; Van M. Savage,"Abstract Temperature responses of many biological traits—including population growth, survival, and development—are described by thermal performance curves (TPCs) with phenomenological models like the Briere function or mechanistic models related to chemical kinetics. Existing TPC models are either simple but inflexible in shape or flexible yet difficult to interpret in biological terms. Here we present flexTPC, a model that is parameterized exclusively in terms of biologically interpretable quantities: the thermal minimum, optimum, and maximum, the peak trait value, and thermal breadth. FlexTPC can describe unimodal temperature responses of any skewness and thermal breadth, enabling direct comparisons across populations, traits, or taxa with a single model. We apply flexTPC to various microbial and entomological datasets, compare results with the widely used Briere model, and find that flexTPC often has better predictive performance. The interpretability of flexTPC makes it ideal for modeling how thermal responses change with ecological stressors or evolve over time.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70251

Sorte,"Abstract Global change is causing a widespread redistribution of species, and novel species are expected to impact populations in their recipient communities. Theory from invasion biology provides a framework to predict the impacts of range‐shifting species. Specifically, the impacts of invasive predators are expected to be nonlinear (greatest per capita effects at low densities) and to be greater in their invaded ranges when compared to their historical ranges. For range‐shifting species, we hypothesized that impacts would similarly be nonlinearly related to abundance and that impacts in the expanded range would be greater than those in the historical range (due to prey naivety and/or enemy release). Our alternative hypothesis was that impacts would be consistent between historical and expanded ranges (due to the potential for historical coevolutionary interactions with species in the expanded range). To test the applicability of this framework with range‐shifting species, we conducted observational surveys and manipulative experiments in the historical and expanded ranges of two predators undergoing poleward expansions, the whelks Acanthinucella spirata and Mexacanthina lugubris . We assessed impacts on prey (acorn barnacles and mussels) abundance and community diversity and compared per capita impacts between regions. As with non‐native invasive species, we found that both whelks reduced the abundance of prey species; however, our results supported a linear relationship and no decrease in per capita effect on prey with increasing density of the shifting predator, and we did not observe consistent impacts of range‐shifting whelks on community diversity. Finally, impacts in whelks' expanded ranges were generally consistent with those in historical ranges, with some potential for increased impact in the expanded range. By adapting invasion frameworks, our work revealed that abundance and impacts in the historical range are indicators of range‐shift impacts that could inform anticipatory management responses to range shifts.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70315

However, food‐web structures can provide process insight in such landscapes by identifying these processes in specific contexts. Here, we used stable isotopes to identify spatially separate resources and infer resource flows underpinning food‐web structures in a braided river. We found that river resources used by mobile consumers, including birds and fish, were spatially heterogeneous. Consumer resource use was related to four key structural food‐web attributes: (1) spatiotemporal variation in foraging, (2) subsidies, (3) omnivory, and (4) ontogenetic niche shifts. Thus, both physical heterogeneity (contextual physical processes) and adaptive characteristics of consumers (mechanistic processes) were likely contributing to important food‐web structures. Identifying these food‐web structures in landscapes, across scales of resource use and spatial distribution, provides a way to identify processes and scales likely contributing to food‐web stabilization.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70306

Although quantification of leaf damage is crucial for understanding many ecological processes, the accuracy and precision of various damage estimation methods used by researchers, including visual estimation, digital image analysis, and artificial intelligence, have not been evaluated and compared. We use a phylogenetically diverse group of tropical plants to compare the accuracy and precision of damage estimation methods and use the results to provide a guide to herbivory estimation that balances the advantages and disadvantages of each method. We found that visual estimation tended to overestimate herbivory levels compared to digital methods but was 15 times faster and improved in accuracy and speed with training. Conversely, deep‐learning algorithms underestimated herbivory relative to image analysis with ImageJ when it was on the margin, but showed similar accuracy for damage inside of leaf margins. Our results indicate that while visual methods allow for rapid assessment of large sample sizes and are suitable for detecting broad patterns of damage, image analysis is crucial for accurate and precise quantification. The disadvantages of each method, however, can be minimized through proper training and efficient use of each tool, and we therefore provide a guide of practical approaches to herbivory estimation.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70308
11,Modeling stratified dispersal in forest pests: A case study of the mountain pine beetle in Alberta,,,,,0.0,Ecology,A,ecology,Evan C. Johnson; Micah Brush; Mark A. Lewis,"Abstract Forest pests pose critical threats to forest ecosystems worldwide, yet accurately predicting their spatial spread remains challenging due to complex dispersal behaviors, weather effects, and the inherent difficulty of tracking small organisms across large landscapes. These challenges have resulted in divergent estimates of typical dispersal distances across studies. Here, we use high‐quality data from helicopter and field‐crew surveys to parameterize dispersal kernels for the mountain pine beetle, a destructive pest that has recently expanded its range into Alberta, Canada. We find that fat‐tailed kernels—those which allow for a small number of long‐distance dispersal events—consistently provide the best fit to these data. Specifically, the radially symmetric Student's t ‐distribution with parameters km and stands out as parsimonious and user‐friendly; this model predicts a median dispersal distance of 60 m, with the percentile of dispersers traveling nearly 5 km. The best‐fitting mathematical models have biological interpretations. The Student's t ‐distribution, derivable as a mixture of diffusive processes with varying settling times, is consistent with observations that mountain pine beetle adults fly short distances while few travel far; early‐emerging beetles fly farther; and larger beetles from larger trees exhibit greater variance in flight distance. This phenotypic variability is mirrored in other forest pests, resulting in a stratified dispersal pattern where most individuals disperse locally while rare long‐distance “jumpers” drive range expansion. Our approach demonstrates how aerial survey data can be used to characterize dispersal patterns, as many insects create diagnostic signatures—combining foliage damage patterns and host‐tree preferences—that are visible from above. Since aerial surveys of North American forests are widely available, our methodology can be broadly used to create parsimonious dispersal models for many forest insects.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70305

Javier Mancera‐Rodríguez; Ian MacGregor‐Fors,"Abstract To contribute to our growing understanding of the urban ecological filtering process in highly biodiverse regions, we conducted a study on bird species assemblages across the landscape of Medellín and its surrounding areas in the Colombian Andes. Nonurban land cover categories included well‐preserved and second‐growth forests, exotic‐tree plantations, and open areas. Urban areas were categorized into four urbanization levels ranging from 0% to 100% built cover at intervals of 25%. Well‐preserved and second‐growth forests exhibited the highest bird species richness, followed by open areas, while the 76%–100% urbanization level displayed the lowest richness. Based on either taxonomic or functional composition, the bird assemblages across all urbanization levels resembled open areas. The other nonurban land cover categories shared a lower proportion of bird species with open areas and all urbanization levels, with well‐preserved forests showing distinct compositions. These results suggest that bird species inhabiting open areas face a broad urban ecological filtering until reaching a threshold above 75% built cover, while birds inhabiting well‐preserved forest face a narrow ecological filtering at the urban edge. Our findings provide insights into urban ecological filtering at the landscape scale and pose significant challenges for urban planners aiming to maintain favorable environmental conditions for highly biodiverse species pools.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70277

Polk; Carolyn A. Currin; Carter S. Smith,"Abstract Living shorelines, a prevalent nature‐based coastal infrastructure technique, typically merge the restoration of coastal habitats (e.g., salt marsh, oyster reef) with gray infrastructure (e.g., rock or concrete breakwaters) to provide coastal erosion protection. With increasingly frequent and severe storms, living shorelines have been shown to effectively limit coastal erosion and loss; however, there is still uncertainty regarding the effects of living shorelines on nekton communities as compared to natural marshes and gray coastal protection strategies like bulkheads. Here, we present a dataset of living shoreline‐associated nekton species recorded over a 20‐year period in North Carolina, USA. We harmonized nekton abundance and biomass data from five different studies (each ranging in duration from 2 to 4 years) across 12 living shorelines with paired natural marshes and, in some cases, bulkheads. These studies used different gear types and sampling methodologies, and therefore future users of this dataset must carefully consider the limitations of different subsets of the data and ensure that they do not make direct catch comparisons across sites that used different methodologies. Altogether, we identified a total of 62 species groups at living shorelines, natural reference marshes, and bulkheads across three categories (i.e., crustacean, mollusk, and fish) between 2001 and 2024. We identified 49 species groups on living shorelines, 49 species groups in natural marshes, and 5 species groups on bulkheads. For each living shoreline and paired natural marsh and/or bulkhead shoreline, we report individual species counts, biomass (when available), and the sampling method. In addition, we report on the living shoreline type, age, and location.

However, variations in “ecosystem multifunctionality” relative to plant functional groups remain unclear, particularly in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems. In particular, how plant presence relates to multifunctionality, whether this directly relates to their carbon inputs, or indirectly, via local changes in abiotic (soil moisture and pH), and biotic (soil biodiversity and their interactions) factors, is still an unresolved question. In this study, we collected soil samples from five areas in the Antarctic region, ranging from bare soil to areas dominated by nonvascular plants such as lichens, mosses, and vascular plants. We examined 12 ecosystem functions associated with carbon sequestration, nitrogen stock and cycling, soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition, microbial biomass and pathogen control to calculate ecosystem multifunctionality. Our results showed that ecosystem multifunctionality was higher in areas colonized by nonvascular plants and vascular plants compared to bare soil, which was concurrent with enhanced levels of carbon sequestration, SOM decomposition, and microbial biomass. Our structural equation model (SEM) showed that increased ecosystem multifunctionality beneath plants was associated with a higher number of microbial module hubs (indicative of stronger interdependence among microbial taxa) in nonvascular plants, but not in vascular plants. Analysis of SEM standardized contributions revealed the direct pathway as predominant in the connectivity pattern between vascular plant presence and ecosystem multifunctionality. Overall, these findings enhance our understanding of the differences in the pathways linking nonvascular plants, vascular plants, and ecosystem multifunctionality. It further highlights the necessity of incorporating microbial interactions to more effectively evaluate ecosystem multifunctionality, particularly in the context of Antarctic ecosystems.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70279

Since it is impossible to allocate management resources to preventing interactions among all resident and introduced species, methods for identifying instances of potential competitive displacement would greatly help focus precious management resources. Additionally, methods that use readily available data, such as species counts or functional traits, are especially advantageous under urgent invasion timelines compared to those requiring more time‐intensive experimental data. Here, we provide a framework for estimating competition outcomes—including displacement—between resident and invading species using species count and functional trait data, two readily available data sources. Our framework provides methods for estimating displacement that is possibly in progress from species count data and estimating possible displacement from functional traits. We apply this framework to the native and introduced gecko species on the Caribbean island of Curaçao. Our work indicates a potential for the displacement of all three native species by introduced species and suggests that the displacement of one native species may already be underway. Given the urgency of the biodiversity crisis, our framework provides a usable tool for the early identification of potentially detrimental interactions from introduced species and provides insights to focus future studies and guide management efforts.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70304

However, there is a lack of evidence and mechanisms for this phenomenon in natural ecosystems. Here, we conducted a large‐scale plant community and spatial pattern survey across 116 sites in the alpine marshes on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Our results showed that the alpine marsh shifted to a stable state characterized by multiple hummock characteristics during degradation. The hummock formation enhanced the compositional similarity between hummock‐associated communities and the desired alpine marsh, thereby driving ecological resilience and making the system less susceptible to catastrophic transitions. Furthermore, an increase in hummock area and height, coupled with a reduction in hummock number, enhanced both environmental heterogeneity and plant beta diversity. In turn, greater environmental heterogeneity positively influenced beta diversity, which subsequently promoted higher compositional similarity across communities, ultimately contributing to increased ecological resilience. This study provides evidence and a mechanism for showing that spatial pattern formation drives resilience in real‐world ecosystems. The findings highlight the necessity of incorporating spatial patterns into strategies for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as well as enhancing ecological resilience in the face of accelerating environmental change.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70301

Shapiro; Zachariah Gompert,"Abstract Climate change has substantially shifted the phenology of many organisms. These shifts vary across species and habitats and are shaped by species' natural history traits and local environmental conditions, yet the relative importance of these drivers remains unclear. Moreover, climate can have diverse effects on different aspects of phenology, such as the timing and duration of activity, but this complexity is rarely captured by commonly used phenological metrics. We used multidecadal butterfly surveys and climate data from five montane sites spanning an elevational gradient to investigate how climate affects different aspects of the annual flight period of 135 butterfly species. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we modeled annual probability of occurrence distributions for species using polynomial models that capture changes in abundance, timing, and length of flight. Spring maximum and minimum temperatures and winter precipitation were the best predictors of interannual variation in phenology. High winter precipitation, which usually comes in the form of snow, delayed phenology, while warmer spring maximum temperatures advanced phenology across elevations. Even modest increases in spring minimum (nighttime) temperatures caused strong phenological shifts. Climate effects varied among sites, among species within sites, and even among populations of the same species across sites, with particularly pronounced variation among species at a single location. Variation in climate effects was slightly better explained by local climate than by natural history traits. Among natural history traits, voltinism and overwintering stage were particularly influential. Importantly, climate influenced different aspects of the flight period (e.g., timing versus duration) in distinct ways, with both natural history traits and local climate modulating these responses. Our findings highlight the often‐overlooked importance of winter precipitation and nighttime temperatures in shaping phenology and demonstrate the value of considering the entire flight period, rather than distinct aspects alone, to improve our understanding and predictions of species response to climate change.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70297
22,Location‐scale models and cross validation to advance quantitative evidence synthesis,,,,,0.0,Ecology,A,ecology,Shane A. Blowes,"Abstract Quantitative evidence synthesis is a prominent path towards generality in ecology. Generality is typically discussed in terms of central tendencies, such as an average effect across a compilation of studies, and the role of heterogeneity for assessing generality is less well developed. Heterogeneity examines the transferability of ecological effects across contexts, though between‐study variance is typically assumed as constant (i.e., homoscedastic). Here, I use two case studies to show how location‐scale models that relax the assumption of homoscedasticity and cross validation can combine to further the goals of evidence syntheses. First, I examine scale‐dependent heterogeneity for a meta‐analysis of plant native‐exotic species richness relationships, quantifying the relationships among unexplained effect size variation, spatial grain and extent.

Hallerman; Eugene G. Maurakis; Emmanuel A. Frimpong,"Abstract Mutualisms are complex, interspecific relationships, which sometimes create “selfish‐herds” as individuals of each species compete to maximize their own fitness. Nest association , where individuals of different species spawn on a nest created by a host species, is a reproductive interaction characteristic of some minnows (Leuciscidae) and is considered mutualistic despite mimicking the behavior labeled “brood parasitism.” We studied the spawning behaviors of bluehead chub ( Nocomis leptocephalus ) and its nest associates, testing the hypothesis that bluehead chub exploits the selfish‐herd dynamic in a novel manner by arranging embryos within its nest to maximize the survival of its own offspring at the expense of the nest associates' offspring. Our results show that embryos were not uniformly distributed within a nest, as one section representing one‐sixth of the nest's total volume contained a disproportionate percentage of embryos ( x¯ = 40.0% ± 6.1% SE). We found three‐quarters of host embryos within deeper nest sections safer from embryo predators, whereas only a third of all associate embryos were found in the same sections. These results support our hypothesis that male Nocomis leptocephalus create “embryonic selfish‐herds” within their nests. This is the first study to document the existence of embryonic selfish‐herds, a phenomenon that warrants the reexamination of some vertebrate reproductive interactions labeled as brood parasitism.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70302
26,Germination speed modulates priority effects: Evidence from a large‐scale field study,,,,,0.0,Ecology,A,ecology,Tamara L. H. van Steijn; Paul Kardol; Roland Jansson; Judith M. Sarneel,"Abstract Priority effects, where species that arrive first influence later arriving species, are often considered in terms of seed arrival time. However, the timing of seedling emergence may play a more critical role, as this defines when plants start interacting. Further, initial seed density may also be important, allowing early‐arriving species with low initial seed density to overcome seed limitation, while also potentially allowing late‐arriving high‐density species to overcome the disadvantage of arriving late. In this large‐scale, multi‐site field experiment, we manipulated species arrival and emergence timing by sowing fast‐ and slow‐germinating meadow species in various arrival orders and seed densities across two climatically contrasting sites in Sweden. Our findings demonstrate that germination speed modulates the strength and direction of priority effects: fast‐germinating species were less affected by both early‐ and late arrival. Conversely, slow‐germinating species were disadvantaged by late arrival and benefited significantly from early arrival, particularly at the more productive, northern site with shorter growing seasons. Contrary to expectations, initial sowing density had limited and inconsistent effects on priority effect outcomes. These results highlight that emergence timing, not just seed arrival, is a key aspect of priority effects, influencing plant competition and community structure. Furthermore, the context dependency across sites emphasizes the importance of environmental conditions in modulating priority effects, with implications for predicting vegetation dynamics under climate change.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70291
27,Pairwise interactions and serial bottlenecks help explain species composition in a multispecies microbial community,,,,,0.0,Ecology,A,ecology,Kasturi Lele; Benjamin E. Wolfe; Lawrence H. Uricchio,"Abstract Characterizing the processes that drive microbial community assembly remains a key challenge in ecology. Several recent studies have argued that pairwise interactions may be insufficient to explain co‐occurrence patterns in complex microbial communities, but most such studies have focused on synthetic communities not found in nature or microbes grown in contexts that differ widely from their natural environment. Moreover, most models of pairwise interactions rely on equilibrium assumptions that are not relevant to all natural communities, such as gut microbiomes or species in fluctuating environments. Inclusion of appropriate demographic factors into models of pairwise interactions could be a potential approach to better capture patterns of community assembly. In this study, we investigated whether multispecies co‐occurrence patterns can be predicted from pairwise interactions for microbes isolated from sourdough starters. Interaction parameters inferred from pairwise growth trajectories were suggestive of widespread coexistence between pairs of microbes in our species pool. In communities of up to nine species, most species' presence and relative abundance could be reliably predicted based on a model of pairwise interactions. The inclusion of nonequilibrium demography in our model further improved the accuracy of our pairwise model. Our work contributes to the broader debate on the processes underlying community assembly by showing that pairwise interactions are predictive of community structure in a system of moderate species complexity.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70284

Carey; Freya Olsson; Adrienne Breef‐Pilz; R. Quinn Thomas,"Abstract As ecology becomes a more predictive discipline, identifying the intrinsic predictability, or stochasticity, of ecosystem variables across space and time is needed to help guide the development of ecological models and forecasts. For example, if an ecological time series has high intrinsic predictability, then a high‐performing model should presumably be able to replicate its dynamics. Conversely, if an ecological variable has low intrinsic predictability, then no model—regardless of its performance—will be able to replicate its dynamics. However, despite the proliferation of ecological models and forecasts, the intrinsic predictability of ecological variables remains largely unknown. To bridge this gap, we analyzed a &gt;4‐year time series of high‐frequency sensor data collected from replicate freshwater ecosystems to determine how intrinsic predictability (quantified as permutation entropy) differs among ecological variables, seasons, and ecosystems. We observed greater differences in predictability among ecological variables and days of year than between ecosystems. Although intrinsic predictability was generally low for all variables, it was still significantly higher than white noise, indicating complex yet predictable dynamics. We observed the highest predictability for physical ecosystem variables (e.g., water temperature) and the lowest predictability for biological variables (e.g., phytoplankton biomass), with chemical variables (e.g., dissolved oxygen) intermediate. We observed substantial seasonal differences in predictability among variables: surface water temperature and dissolved organic matter exhibited their highest levels of predictability in autumn, whereas surface chlorophyll and bottom‐layer dissolved oxygen and temperature exhibited highest predictability in summer. Periods of anoxia (low oxygen) were associated with the highest levels of predictability in dissolved oxygen over the time series. Altogether, our analysis highlights how intrinsic predictability data can both guide ecological model development and improve our understanding of how ecological predictability varies across space and time.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70292

As such, the proportion of empty stomachs provides insights into the effects of prey on predators and vice versa, although it is typically unreported in deference to descriptions of the contents of the non‐empty stomachs. The FracFeed database is an ongoing compilation of the proportions of empty and non‐empty stomachs (for gut content surveys) and of feeding and not feeding individuals (for direct observation surveys) reported in publications of predator diet surveys. FracFeed contains data from 4920 diet surveys on 1507 taxa (&gt;4.3 million individuals) spanning cnidarians, ctenophores, chaetognaths, birds, annelids, amphibians, arthropods, mammals, mollusks, reptiles, echinoderms, and fishes that were surveyed in terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems across the globe over more than 135 years (1887–2023). For most surveys, covariate data include information on the spatial and temporal extent of the diet survey, its central geographical coordinates, the method by which the survey was performed (lethal gut contents, lavage, or direct observation), as well as each predator's standardized taxonomic name and identifier in the Open Tree of Life, its body mass (compiled mostly from independent compilations and additional publications), and its apparent diet's taxonomic richness and resolution. We appeal to more researchers who perform diet surveys to report on the number of empty stomachs they find and encourage additional contributions to the database—particularly from underrepresented geographic regions (e.g., North and Central Asia, North and Central Africa)—to help grow its scope and utility.

Karelitz; Rachele Ferraro; Laura Rogers‐Bennett; Rachel D. Simons; Daniel K. Okamoto,"Abstract Biologists often use organismal thermal tolerance to help explain or forecast responses of populations to climate change. Yet many studies quantify thermal tolerance under isolated laboratory conditions despite extreme events, such as heatwaves, often coinciding with other stressors such as nutrient or food limitation. These oversights may be consequential as recent theory suggests thermal tolerance itself can be fundamentally altered by food limitation. Here, we experimentally test how food limitation (500–10,000 cells mL −1 ) affects long‐term survival, development, and growth across a present‐day range of temperatures (10–20°C) in the most sensitive life stages of an important marine herbivore, purple sea urchins ( Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ). We show food limitation substantially erodes thermal tolerance in terms of survival, but when provided ample food, larvae exhibited robust survival across temperatures currently experienced by larvae in nature. Reductions in food however lowered optimal survival temperatures and shifted survival thresholds to those conditions observed during recent marine heatwaves. These results are consistent with the “metabolic meltdown” hypothesis—shifting optima and upper limits to cooler temperatures—and illustrate how present‐day warming coupled with lower productivity may lead to substantial, unexpected declines in larval survival and recruitment. In contrast to survival, developmental rates and time to metamorphic competency, which ranged from 21 to 61 days, were driven largely by temperature with little impact of food concentration. Our findings relate to historical observations of declines in larval supply at the southern edge of the species range. Overall, these results have broad‐reaching implications beyond sea urchin populations as sea urchin herbivory is known to control productivity of kelp forest communities. We provide evidence of how laboratory derived thermal reaction norms can be coupled with ecologically relevant food concentrations to inform unexpected vital rate declines of sensitive life stages in a changing climate.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70288

Reece; Jeffrey D. Shields,"Abstract As a mechanism of the dilution effect, predation and filter feeding on parasitic propagules are hypothesized to reduce transmission to susceptible hosts and alter host–parasite interactions. In marine systems, the effect of other community members on the disease dynamics of microparasites in their suitable hosts is poorly known. In a coastal estuarine host–parasite system, we examined how eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica , affect the transmission of a parasitic dinoflagellate, Hematodinium perezi , to juvenile blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus . We deployed juvenile blue crabs in custom mesh bags that were sandwiched by oysters into holo‐endemic areas, or areas with high endemic transmission for the parasite in juvenile hosts. Controls consisted of juvenile crabs deployed with an equivalent number of oyster shells to test for the effect of rugosity on transmission and crabs deployed alone. Deployments lasted 7–13 days and were done over different temporal and spatial scales. Results from the field deployments suggest that oysters, not shells, reduced the probability of infection to crab hosts. To investigate consumption in the laboratory, single oysters in 1 L aquaria were fed dinospores of H. perezi released from infected crabs. Oysters reduced parasite densities in the water at rates similar to those observed for a common phytoplankton, Tetraselmis chui , that is grown specifically as oyster food. Our results jointly support that oysters benefit adjacent community members through feeding on transmissive stages of their pathogens and highlight the need for additional field‐based approaches addressing environmental heterogeneity in pathogen transmission.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70281

We provide here a dataset that collects dietary data from 36 populations belonging to seven of the eight Speleomantes species ( S. strinatii , S. ambrosii , S. italicus , S. flavus , S. imperialis , S. sarrabusensis , S. genei ) and the natural hybrid zone S. italicus × S. ambrosii . Eleven populations were sampled in natural and artificial subterranean environments for a total surveyed area of 4667 m 2 . Twenty‐five surface populations were sampled in woodlands, garrigues, and dry‐stone walls for a total surveyed area of 34,640 m 2 . Data collection took place from 2021 to 2024. Twenty‐seven populations were surveyed only once; the other nine were surveyed twice during different seasons/years. The dataset contains information on a total of 1108 captured salamanders. Captured individuals were weighed using a digital scale and photographed in a portable photo studio to obtain high‐quality images used for post hoc measurements. This allows us to assess potential variation in the body condition of individuals over time (e.g., during different years or seasons) and identify potential divergences between conspecific populations. We used stomach flushing to obtain the stomach contents of the salamanders, which were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively using the stereomicroscope. In 930 salamanders, we could recognize 8899 consumed prey items belonging to 50 different prey categories (e.g., order level or lower). These data, in addition to adding new populations to the overall Speleomantes dataset, allow us to compare aboveground and subterranean Speleomantes populations to identify potential variations in trophic niche breadth that have occurred in populations that have colonized subterranean environments.

Branston; Pablo Capilla‐Lasheras; Conor Haugh; Paul J. Baker; Rachel Reid; Kate Griffiths; Stewart White; Davide M. Dominoni,"Abstract Urban areas are altered from natural landscapes in several ways that can impact wildlife. Birds are widespread in urban areas, and it is well documented that there are phenotypic differences between urban and non‐urban conspecifics. However, little is known about which characteristics of the urban environment are driving differences. We used 9 years of data from nest boxes spread across 20 sites along a 40‐km urban–non‐urban gradient in Scotland to test whether characteristics of the urban environment (native, non‐native, native oak ( Quercus spp.), birch ( Betula spp.) foliage availability, temperature and human population density, and the interaction between foliage and temperature) influenced phenology and reproductive success in blue tits ( Cyanistes caeruleus ). We found that higher foliage availability of native foliage, and specifically of the most common native genus, oak, was associated at the territory level with earlier first egg laying date. Higher non‐native foliage availability at both a site and territory level was negatively related to clutch size. The number of fledglings produced was reduced at sites with higher levels of non‐native foliage and increased at sites with greater amounts of native oak foliage present. We also found territories with a higher human population density had reduced fledging success. Temperature was negatively related to first egg laying date, clutch size and the number of fledglings produced. Moreover, the number of Lepidopteran larvae, blue tits' preferred prey, that were collected over the breeding season was positively related to native oak foliage availability. Our results strongly indicate that the presence of native trees, such as oak, are beneficial to breeding insectivores by increasing the number of fledglings they can successfully raise, likely due to the increased availability of invertebrate prey. We suggest that urban planting regimes should be carefully considered, selecting tree species that are native or non‐native congeneric species, and most importantly that will host Lepidoptera larvae. This will not only help to support complete food chains, but also to maximize biodiversity and ecosystem services of urban green spaces.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70294

Ecological interactions are key drivers of these transitions, and theory suggests that the networks formed by these interactions can undergo their own critical transition. By examining interactions between plant individuals and insect species in a tropical forest, we first identified a critical network structural transition between the rainy and dry seasons. Next, we showed that seasonal changes and the phytochemical diversity of plants are associated with this transition. Finally, we quantified the consequences of the critical transition, which significantly increases the number of pathways and the potential for cascading effects among plants and herbivores in the network. Our findings reveal that ecological networks can experience abrupt changes on shorter timescales than previously recognized, with profound implications for cascading effects and the impacts of human‐induced perturbations on the stability of ecological assemblages.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70282

Drost; Carmen Kowarik; Maja Ilić; Martin M. Gossner; Carsten J. Schubert,"Abstract Understanding the mechanisms shaping food chain length (FCL) has long been central to food web ecology. FCL is a key determinant of stability, energy flow efficiency, and biodiversity maintenance, but there is an ongoing debate about its underlying drivers. It is particularly important in meta‐ecosystems, where predator trophic position (TP) is influenced by multiple energy channels. In this study, we focused on spiders in riparian ecosystems, which rely on resources linked to distinct energy channels: blue (algal herbivory), green (terrestrial herbivory), and brown (terrestrial detritivory). We applied nitrogen isotope analysis of amino acids to estimate the TP of both spiders and their prey. This method is a powerful tool for determining TP from a single sample and even allows for capturing decomposer trophic steps. However, the TP estimate requires special care for riparian spiders, as spiders show a specific trophic discrimination factor (TDF Glx‐Phe ), and that energy channel use can confound the TP estimate. Our detailed food web resolution supports the use of specific parameters for spiders, particularly the low trophic discrimination factor (TDF Glx‐Phe ~ 2‰), and raises caution about the importance of estimating resource use of predators to estimate their TP. We show that the primary factor driving variation in spider TP is the energy channel they utilize, from blue (TP ~ 2.9) to green (TP ~ 3.6) to brown (TP ~ 4.1). This increase was largely due to prey omnivory in green channels, and microbial and fungal decomposers serving as an initial trophic step between litter and invertebrate detritivores in brown channels. We propose that this pattern is likely influenced by differences in basal nutritional quality, which increases from brown (low) to green (medium) and to blue (high) sources. This suggests that shifts in energy channels within meta‐ecosystems in the course of global change (e.g., climate warming, eutrophication and land‐use change) may significantly impact FCL, with significant consequences for trophic interactions, nutrient fluxes, and biomagnification processes.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70264

Moles,"Abstract The enemy release hypothesis posits that introduced species escape some of their predators, pathogens, and parasites when they move to a new range. We used a systematic review to compile data from 691 contrasts of enemy release spanning plants, animals, and algae in aquatic and terrestrial systems worldwide. Data from 311 biogeographic contrasts (between home and new range) revealed that on average, a species experiences only 43% as much enemy pressure in their introduced range as they experience in their native range. Data from 380 community contrasts (between native and introduced species) revealed that introduced species experience on average 70% of the enemy pressure that their native congeners endure. Interestingly, one third (36%) of contrasts showed higher, rather than lower, enemy pressure on the introduced population. Enemy release was well supported in contrasts of the diversity of enemies and enemy damage but not significant in contrasts of host fitness, suggesting that while introduced populations are attacked by fewer enemies, this does not always result in higher fitness. We also found that biogeographic enemy release was higher in mollusks and fish but lower in insects and algae, indicating that certain taxa may be favored by enemy release. We hope that an improved understanding of the extent to which introduced species are released from enemy pressures will help managers to identify good opportunities for biocontrol and to understand the factors likely to be affecting the success of invasive species.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70276

Navarrete,"Abstract Over the past decades, our understanding of the vital role microbes play in ecosystem processes has greatly expanded. However, we still have limited knowledge about how microbial communities interact with larger organisms. Many existing representations of microbial interactions are based on co‐occurrence patterns, which do not provide clear insights into trophic or non‐trophic relationships. In this study, we untangled trophic and non‐trophic interactions between macroscopic and microscopic organisms on a marine rocky shore. Five abundant mollusk grazers were selected, and their consumptive (grazing) and nonconsumptive (grazer pedal mucus) interactions with bacteria in biofilms were measured using 16S rRNA‐gene amplicon sequencing. While no significant effects on a commonly used measure of biofilm grazing (chlorophyll a concentration) were observed, detailed image analysis revealed that all grazers had a detrimental impact on biofilm cover. Moreover, different grazers exhibited distinct effects on various bacterial groups. Members of the Alteromonadaceae, Burkholderiaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Halieaceae, Phycisphaeraceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Rickettsiaceae, Saprospiraceae, and Vibrionaceae families experienced positive trophic effects from specific grazers. In contrast, members of the Flavobacteriaceae, Pirellulaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Rubritaleaceae, and Saprospiraceae families were negatively affected by trophic interactions with other grazers. Some members of the Gammaproteobacteria, Flavobacteriaceae, Ilumatobacteraceae, Pirellulaceae, Rickettsiales, Rhodobacteraceae, and Rubritaleaceae families exhibited non‐trophic positive interactions with specific grazers. Meanwhile, members of the Family DEV007 (Verrucomicrobiales), Flavobacteriaceae, Ilumatobacteraceae, Legionellaceae, Rickettsiales, Rhodobacteraceae, Saprospiraceae, and Xanthobacteraceae families exhibited non‐trophic negative interactions with particular grazers. Both trophic and non‐trophic interactions shift the microbial community toward enhanced recycling, energy efficiency, and stress resilience. Grazer activity, through biomass removal and exudates like pedal mucus, reduces photosynthetic groups like diatoms, halting dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) production and negatively impacting sulfur‐cycling bacteria and associated parasites. This research complements the ecological network of the intertidal rocky shore in central Chile and represents the first attempt to construct an interaction network between macroorganisms and bacteria. It reveals that the strength of trophic and non‐trophic interactions varies depending on the grazer and bacterial group involved. While some bacterial groups responded broadly, others showed specialized responses to specific macroorganisms. Overall, this study highlights the potential for integrating microbes into ecological networks, offering valuable insights methodologies for quantifying interactions across domains.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecy.70275

We leveraged an unprecedented large‐scale dataset of nine leaf traits for 5718 species‐site combinations with simultaneous field measurements of plant community composition in 64 naturally assembled communities to investigate trait spaces (hypervolume, quantity dimension) and trait compactness (coordination, efficiency dimension) and their influence on GPP. Trait space and compactness combined explained 72% of the variation of GPP. Interestingly, a larger trait space (more diverse trait combinations) drove higher GPP in resource‐poor communities, while higher trait compactness (greater coordination of traits) determined higher GPP in resource‐rich communities.

However, the interplay between community thermophilization driven by temporal warming in global climate and spatial warming in local climate is not well explored empirically. Here, we use long‐term ecological monitoring of ground‐dwelling arthropod communities over twenty years, sited in desert and urbanized habitats, to address the joint effects of spatiotemporal warming on community thermophilization. We found spatial convergence of high community thermophily among warm desert and highly urbanized sites, implicating temperature as a major driver of community composition. However, we found unexpected temporal declines in community thermophily, the magnitude of which depended upon space. Declines were found in urbanized sites, but not desert sites.

Here, we analyse evolutionary pathways into this harsh environment, as a continuum defined by two potential endmembers—a ‘piecemeal model’, with exclusively deep-sea species (deep-sea endemics herein) derived from multiple, independent entries and an ‘in situ diversification model’ with one entry followed by species proliferation. We focus first on two ancient, distantly related subclades in Class Bivalvia, Mytilidae and Lucinidae, each with hundreds of species occurring globally from the intertidal to abyssal plains. Placing bathymetric ranges into newly inferred molecular phylogenies, we find that the deep-sea endemics within Lucinidae derive in piecemeal fashion, estimating up to 16 phylogenetically isolated entries and perhaps one modest in situ diversification. Mytilidae entered the deep sea just four times, with most endemics stemming from the prolific in situ diversification of Bathymodiolinae. We suggest that the contrasting phylogenetic patterns of entry and proliferation in these clades may be determined by differences in ancestral adult feeding modes. Across Bivalvia, we find that under half of extant families have deep-sea endemics, with the piecemeal model occurring more frequently. Taken together with other clades, we suggest that evolutionary pathways to deep-sea endemicity are more often shaped by multiple, independent events than by in situ diversification.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2002

However, tall and short species occupy distinct microhabitats and employ different adaptive strategies, raising the possibility of divergent responses to nitrogen. Using a 13-year experiment (2011–2023) in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, we examined how nitrogen addition influences species diversity (richness, evenness) and temporal stability of biomass in tall versus short species. We found that nitrogen enrichment has opposing effects on tall and short species. Specifically, nitrogen addition increased temporal stability of tall species, mainly by increasing species asynchrony. In contrast, nitrogen addition decreased temporal stability of short species by decreasing both species asynchrony and species stability, and these changes were mediated by a reduction in species richness. At the community scale (i.e. tall and short species combined), the negative effects of nitrogen addition on diversity and stability were driven by the responses of tall species, short species and the compensatory dynamics between them. By partitioning species according to height, our study reveals contrasting trait-based responses to nitrogen enrichment and highlights the importance of key attributes such as plant height in shaping biodiversity–stability relationships under global change.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2260

Single-species research shows that noise can impact different aspects of bird behaviour and consequently reduce their fitness. However, we have a limited understanding of how ecological and life-history traits mediate responses to anthropogenic noise across species. We performed a meta-analysis to quantify noise impacts on bird behaviours (communication, cognition, aggression, risk, foraging and habitat use) and fitness-related responses (growth, physiology and reproduction), and how bird traits, such as nesting and habitat type, mediated those responses. Using 944 effect sizes from 160 bird species across six continents, we found that anthropogenic noise significantly affected various behaviours as well as physiology and had strong negative effects on reproductive responses. We also found that anthropogenic noise had stronger negative effects on bird reproduction for species that nest nearer to the ground, while growth and physiological responses were stronger for species that nested in open rather than cavity nests and those living in deciduous forests, respectively. Our results highlight the characteristics of those birds most vulnerable to noise pollution and inform how conservation actions can best reduce the impacts of human-made noise in those species’ habitats.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2521

In deep-sea hot vents and cold seeps, invertebrates have independently evolved symbioses with chemosynthetic bacteria, but repeated origins of such associations within a family remain rare. Here, we investigate the evolutionary emergence of chemosymbiosis in the shrimp family Alvinocarididae across 22 species collected globally. Electron microscopy identified a gradient of epibiotic bacterial colonization within the cephalothoracic cavity, ranging from absent to dense filamentous mats, suggesting distinct trophic strategies. Isotope and lipid trophic markers confirmed differences in reliance on chemosynthetic production among sympatric species with different bacterial colonization from a single vent. Phylogenetic analysis reveals at least two independent origins of chemosymbiosis, suggesting evolutionary convergence. Microhabitat association data further show that symbiotic phenotypes are most common in shrimps occupying the hottest, most geofluid-enriched microhabitats, though exceptions suggest contributions from additional ecological or physiological constraints. Our findings reveal many alvinocaridids as gradually evolving towards reliance on symbiosis, highlighting the importance of intermediate cases to understand the pathways to chemosymbiosis. This study contributes to a broader understanding of the predictability of evolutionary outcomes in dynamic habitats such as vents, with broader implications for resilience of deep-sea ecosystems.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2883

In humans, jealousy is particularly salient in sibships, where children often disrupt affiliative parent–sibling interactions. Jealousy could similarly mediate competitive interactions among siblings in animals. Here, we examine the context, targets and function of sibling interference in mother–offspring grooming interactions in wild chacma baboons. We test the jealousy hypothesis proposing that juveniles interfere to disrupt parent–sibling affiliation without immediate reward, alongside two alternatives stating that interference instead aims at interacting with the mother or sibling. Our results support the jealousy hypothesis, with patterns strikingly echoing observations on children. First, juveniles approach their mother more often when she is grooming a sibling than when she is socially available. Second, they preferentially target same-sex and younger siblings, as well as ‘maternal favourites’ that receive a disproportionate share of maternal grooming. Third, interference is more successful at disrupting mother–sibling grooming than at obtaining attention from either the mother or the sibling. This study introduces a novel framework to study the expression of jealousy and the emotional mechanisms underpinning family conflicts in animals, thereby opening perspectives in the growing field of the ecology of emotions.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2102

The paradigm for appendage evolution in this phylum is that the gene regulatory network responsible for leg subdivision and patterning is broadly conserved. Recent surveys of these genes have suggested that chelicerate exemplars exhibit divergent appendage patterning dynamics, though functional data remain limited. One salient mismatch in expression occurs in homologues of the homeobox gene clawless. In insects, clawless is expressed in the distalmost leg territory, specifying the claw-bearing pretarsus. In the harvestman Phalangium opilio, clawless occupies a broad tarsal domain early in development, localizing later to the metatarsus-tarsus boundary, suggestive of a tarsal patterning function. Here, we tested the function of harvestman clawless using RNA interference. Unlike insects, we show that clawless knockdown results in disrupted tarsal growth and patterning of its proximal segmental boundary, with no effect on the claw. Truncation of the tarsus is associated with defective tarsomere formation. We additionally surveyed the expression of clawless homologues in exemplars of chelicerate diversity, which suggests that the tarsal-patterning function for clawless was likely present in the most recent common ancestor of Chelicerata. These results join a suite of other comparative works suggesting that panarthropod appendage patterning exhibits numerous cases of developmental system drift.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2557

Using morphological measurements in embryos and fry, gene expression analysis and hybrid crosses, we describe divergence in reproductive strategy between two closely related species of swordtail fish (Xiphophorus), which have internal fertilization and give birth to free-swimming fry. We find that one species, Xiphophorus malinche, has evolved larger offspring than its closest relative Xiphophorus birchmanni and dwarfs the offspring size of other species in the genus. The fry of X. malinche are more resilient to starvation than X. birchmanni, hinting that the evolution of large offspring size could be an adaptation to the challenging environments in which X. malinche are born. We also find evidence that X. malinche mothers provision nutrients to their offspring during embryonic development, the first time this process has been documented in the Xiphophorus genus. Moreover, in the ovary, we observe differential regulation of genes associated with maternal nutrient provisioning in other groups that use this reproductive strategy. Finally, we generated hybrid crosses between X. malinche and X. birchmanni to explore the impact of genetics and maternal environment on offspring size, finding that offspring size is at least in part genetically determined. Intriguingly, we find a low rate of survival in one cross direction and investigate the links between reproductive strategy and this asymmetric hybrid incompatibility.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.1945

Nevertheless, an anti-egalitarian, self-serving aspect of human sociality—corruption—often threatens institutions’ integrity. While much is known about how prosocial reciprocity emerges in different settings, human preferences against corrupt reciprocity are poorly understood. Here, we test how one of such preferences, aversion to taking bribes, develops in 3–11-year-old children (N = 697) from four societies that differ in their corruption and interdependence levels: Norway, Japan, the USA and Italy. To examine whether bribe rejection is grounded in basic egalitarian motives, we also test children’s inequity aversion. We find that inequity aversion is dissociated from bribe-taking aversion: whereas humans’ rejection of unequal allocations emerges across settings by age 10 years (and, in some settings and studies, as early as age 3), we find that bribe rejection is present during late childhood in some contexts only. We discuss these findings while considering questions about culture’s role in shaping preferences against human selfishness.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2523

In size-structured ecosystems, the shape of trophic pyramids is often inferred from their size spectra—the distribution of biomass across body-mass classes. Size-spectrum analysis has become a popular tool to study ecosystem functioning in aquatic ecosystems, including coral reefs. However, the key assumption behind size spectra, that body size directly and positively correlates with trophic position, has rarely been evaluated in these systems. Here, we test this assumption by quantifying body mass, population densities and estimating trophic position from stable isotopes for 325 fish species across four Indo-Pacific locations. Consistent with prior studies, we found a positive relationship between biomass and body mass. However, weak and variable relationships between body mass and trophic position led to higher biomass in primary consumers than in predators, as expected in traditional bottom-heavy or diamond-shaped trophic structures. Our findings thus challenge previous reports of coral reef fish biomass prevalence in higher trophic levels (e.g. inverted biomass pyramids), supporting earlier suggestions that simple size-spectrum models do not adequately represent the trophic structure of reef fish communities.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2357

Adapted for efficient upright walking and running, the human pelvis forms a rigid ring that leaves little leeway for parturition and causes a relatively high risk of obstructed labour. Static mechanics suggests that a wider pelvis increases the energy demands of the abductor muscles during locomotion. Recent empirical studies, however, have not observed a significant increase in whole-body locomotor costs in individuals with wider pelves. To investigate this discrepancy, we employed a detailed musculoskeletal model and predictive forward modelling to simulate human gait while systematically varying body dimensions beyond modern human variation. Our results confirm that a wider pelvis substantially increases abductor muscle energy demands and activation (± 10% for ± 20% width change), consistent with predictions based on lever mechanics. However, during dynamic walking, these increased demands are offset by a redistribution of energy costs to other muscles, leading to only minimal increases in whole-body metabolic cost (± 1% for ± 20% width change). In contrast, lower limb length shows a 2.5-fold greater effect on metabolic cost than pelvic width. These findings reconcile static mechanics predictions with whole-body measurements: while abductor muscle costs increase with pelvic width as predicted, these costs are compensated mainly at the organismal level. We propose that if locomotor costs constrained pelvic evolution, they likely operated through subsystem-level mechanisms, such as muscle-specific energetics and fatigue, rather than whole-body energy economy.",,,0.0,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2895

Yet, their use in marine systems is rare. Here, we investigate neodymium (Nd) isotope ratios, a radiogenic isotope system that is rarely used in biology but has characteristics that make it useful for marine biological applications. Nd isotope ratios are influenced by continental geology; as such, we analysed 143Nd/144Nd or ƐNd in 112 gastropod shells (abalone) collected from 11 geologically diverse sites in southern Australia. We found strong spatial differences in isotope ratios, which ranged from −18.2 ƐNd in the west of Australia to −3.4 ƐNd in the east. Such differences can be broadly linked to exposed continental rock age—a trend that was also apparent when comparing our data to published ƐNd data from northeast Asia. This study represents, to our knowledge, the largest analysis of ƐNd in modern biological material and provides insight into spatial trends and its usefulness as a radiogenic marker. Our findings highlight the exciting potential of ƐNd as a tool for biologists to understand marine animal movement and the origins of marine products.",,,0.0,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.1652

Ross Robertson; Carole Baldwin; Philip Hastings; Ricardo Betancur-R.,"Abstract Because ocean environments often lack clear barriers to dispersal, cryptobenthic reef fishes, with their limited mobility, are ideal for uncovering spatial patterns of evolutionary divergence. We conducted a comparative phylogeographic study of 23 of the 25 known species in the cryptobenthic genus Malacoctenus, integrating genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (&amp;gt;500 individuals), geometric morphometrics and seascape data to evaluate historical and contemporary barriers in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) and Greater Caribbean (GC). Population analyses across 14 species revealed well-structured populations with limited admixture, emphasizing the system’s value for assessing marine barrier permeability. In the TEP, linear coastlines and broad sandy gaps, such as the Sinaloan, Central American, and Galápagos breaks, consistently restricted gene flow. By contrast, the GC showed more variable structure shaped by currents and its semi-enclosed geography, with pronounced breaks across the Eastern Caribbean, Bahamas and Gulf of Mexico. Seascape genomic analyses identified depth, temperature and chlorophyll-α as key environmental drivers, with depth particularly important in separating tide pool- and reef-associated clades. Phylogenomic analyses revealed an early divergence (approx. 23 Ma) between TEP and GC lineages, followed by asynchronous transisthmian speciation in two clades (approx. 5–7 Ma). Overall, our findings demonstrate how historical processes, marine barriers and environmental gradients shape diversification in cryptobenthic fishes.",,,0.0,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2591

We analyse how research questions in Wolbachia replacement modelling have developed over time and in response to empirical findings. A scoping review was conducted of Wolbachia replacement models. For each study, we extracted research questions, key findings and modelling methodology and thematically categorized research questions. From 726 search results, 115 studies met inclusion criteria. Four themes were identified: identifying key Wolbachia characteristics (n = 61, 53.0%), investigating effects of environmental heterogeneity (n = 21, 18.3%), estimating epidemiological impact (n = 25, 21.7%) and exploring Wolbachia replacement in combination with other arboviral control measures (n = 8, 7.0%). Models identify cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) and maternal transmission (MT) as key for fixation success. However, less than 20% (n = 6) of studies parameterize CI and MT using empirical sources. Although models agree outbreaks may occur with fixation, few explore epidemiological outcomes of heterogeneous Wolbachia fixation or combined vector control. These findings highlight the need for empirical parameterization and incorporating environmental complexity for models to remain insightful for decision-making.

Marx; Jeremy A. Draghi,"Abstract Heritable non-genetic phenotypic variation—broadly, epigenetics—can potentially influence evolutionary outcomes as direct targets of selection or through interactions with genetic variation. While their evolutionary benefits in generating phenotypic diversity in changing environments are well-characterized, there has been relatively little consideration of how the joint influence of epigenetic changes and mutations would affect traversal of multi-peak adaptive landscapes. Here, we discover general principles for how epigenetics, by generating an epigenetic quasispecies (clusters of semi-stable phenotypes mapped to a single genotype), tends to improve adaptive outcomes of an asexual population on rugged fitness landscapes even in a constant environment. In particular, rapid epigenetic changes tend to smooth out suboptimal fitness peaks through incorporating fitness contributions of epimutations, allowing access to better adaptive outcomes. Remarkably, the average impact of epigenetics is more strongly influenced by an approximate balance between switching rates rather than the absolute rate at which switching occurs. These findings demonstrate that epigenetic changes can be influential even without having strong heritability and have a striking, yet generally invisible, beneficial role in shaping a population’s adaptive trajectory.",,,0.0,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2619

Molina; Ignasi Bartomeus,"Abstract Previous research has revealed how species traits determine species interactions, and how species interactions influence species coexistence. However, this hierarchical view ignores the coevolutionary feedback from species interactions to species traits and its consequences for species coexistence. Here, we developed a theoretical model of quantitative genetics to explore how the coevolution of morphological and phenological traits shapes the structure and stability of mutualistic interaction networks. We found that, in comparison to morphological traits, phenological traits led to distinctive species evolutionary trajectories, resulting in different emergent properties at the community level. This is because phenological traits promoted facilitation over competition. While morphological coevolution gave rise to modular and specialized interaction networks with a negative diversity-stability trade-off, phenological coevolution was required for the emergence of nested interaction networks that exhibited a positive relationship between diversity and structural stability. Empirical observations from 17 pollination networks were consistent with the theoretical results: we found many phenological motifs promoting facilitation over competition, suggesting an important role of phenological coevolution in community assembly. The seasonal organization of empirical interactions enhanced the community stability and dampened the diversity-stability trade-off that was observed when aggregating interactions across time. Our results highlight the importance of phenological coevolution in the emergence of diverse and stable communities.",,,0.0,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2808

In terrestrial species, these often include noxious compounds and aposematic signalling, but little is known in freshwater environments. Here, we unravel the evolutionary and ecological strategies of Pomacea, aquatic snails that lay conspicuous masses of toxic orange-pink eggs to reduce predation risk. We reveal the interplay among warning coloration, toxicity and predator visual perception that enables the evolution of advanced chemical defences. We provide evidence that snails modify dietary carotenoids and that this controls egg coloration in a clade-specific manner. Snails from the canaliculata clade accumulate more and brighter-coloured egg carotenoid pigments than those from the bridgesii clade. The conspicuousness of colour signals was assessed using field data, spectral reflectance measurements and visual modelling. We show that aposematic signal variation among species is likely noticeable to putative waterbird predators. Feeding egg extracts to birds adversely affected their gut morphology. Comparative analysis revealed a correlation among pigment modification, conspicuousness and toxicity, demonstrating that colour acts as an honest aposematic signal in apple snail eggs.

Freedman; Simon A. Levin; Stephen A. Felt; Giulio De Leo,"Abstract Disease ecology has focused greatly on determining how changes to biodiversity may drive infectious disease risk for humans. Fencing off experimental areas (exclosures) has been a common experimental approach to assess how removing large-bodied hosts may affect disease risk, especially with tick-borne pathogens (TBPs). However, exclosure experiments have found conflicting results based on the experiment’s scale, with smaller exclosures tending to increase tick densities inside the exclosure and larger exclosures tending to decrease tick densities inside. Previously, we have lacked a unifying theoretical framework able to reconcile the results of exclosure experiments across spatial scales. We present a spatially explicit model of TBP risk incorporating tick dispersal by small transmission-competent mammal hosts who can enter the exclosure and by large transmission-incompetent mammal hosts excluded from the exclosure. Our model reproduces the scale-dependence and spatial patterning observed in past exclosure experiments while elucidating their causal mechanisms. Specifically, the modeled exclosures produce high densities of infected ticks near their boundaries, with the densities decreasing towards the exclosure’s centre. Empirical results have found lower tick densities at the exclosure’s edge than its centre, a pattern we demonstrate can also be produced if we additionally allow ticks in their free-living questing stage to disperse.",,,0.0,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2560

However, some flowers combine colours associated with different pollinators, suggesting bimodal adaptation. The perennial herb Cyrtanthus obliquus produces red corollas with yellow tips and is pollinated by birds and bees. To assess the role of the two pollinator categories in shaping selection on the bicoloured corollas, we examined bee choices in arrays where the colour signals of plants had been manipulated, and we quantified total as well as bird-mediated phenotypic selection on flower colour in an unmanipulated natural population, using bird and bee visual models. Bees preferred flowers with a yellow signal over all-red flowers. The analysis of phenotypic selection indicated that both birds and bees influence net selection on flower colour, resulting in conflicting selection on the colour contrast between corolla and corolla tip. Our findings show that the optimal phenotype should depend on the relative importance of the two categories of pollinators in a given population and are consistent with bimodal adaptation.

Behavioural responses to these threats impact individual fitness and often affect population, community and ecosystem outcomes.

Relatively few have tested for consistent individual differences (CIDs) in response to other common threats (e.g. pathogens, chemical stressors, fire). If behavioural responses to different threats are correlated (i.e. if individuals exhibit fear generalization), this could connect disparate sources of mortality otherwise treated as separate. Despite its potential significance, no studies to date have examined fear generalization in ecological contexts. Here, we assayed behavioural responses of wolf spiders (Schizocosa maxima) to cues associated with predation, fire and pesticide. We provide the first study to quantify CIDs in response to smoke and one of few to document CIDs in response to pesticide.

Cooperative foraging, a mutualistic resource acquisition behaviour observed across diverse taxa, is strongly connected to social networks via behavioural states, cues and often social learning, as it typically involves high interaction rates. Understanding the distribution, diffusion and learning mechanisms of such cooperative behaviours is an important but understudied aspect of nonhuman culture. Bubble net feeding (‘bubble netting’) is a specialized foraging technique practised by certain humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) populations globally. Over 20 years in the northern Canadian Pacific, we observed the diffusion of two forms: cooperative group and independent (or ‘solo’) bubble netting. Network-based diffusion analysis—a tool to test for social learning—finds strong evidence for social learning of bubble netting when the overall social network is used, even after accounting for traits such as site fidelity and sex (10.6 × 103 to 35.4 × 103 times more support for social versus asocial learning; p &amp;lt; 0.0001).

Combining multilocus genetic data, radular morphology and model-based historical biogeography, we aim to understand the origins of these disparities in range extent. The paraphyly detected in both Laevilitorina and Laevilacunaria genus indicates a more complex history than a simple older–younger genus contrast, with age and diversification distributed across four clades. Our dated analyses place the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of Laevilitorininae at 52.2 Mya, with diversification within clades from the Miocene to Pleistocene. The sister genera show process-level contrasts: in Laevilitorina, broad ranges in some lineages are consistent with intermittent, macroalgal raft-mediated connectivity, whereas Laevilacunaria exhibits restricted ranges consistent with rare, storm-facilitated rafting that enables colonization without sustained gene flow.

HSB are thought to increase resistance to abrasive food and mitigate crack propagation and hence are considered a mammalian adaptation to high-efficiency mastication. Using traditional microscopy techniques as well as X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT), here we report for the first time the presence of HSB-like features in the tooth enamel of a non-mammalian amniote, Iharkutosuchus, an extinct herbivorous crocodile with strong heterodonty and a unique chewing mechanism.

The unexpected finding of both enamel features in this herbivorous crocodile speaks for their role in high-efficiency chewing.

One question with important implications for adaptive decision making is whether we learn about the absolute values of cues we encounter (how good or bad?) or about their relative values (how much better or worse than the alternative?). Humans have been shown to use relative value learning, even when it leads to suboptimal decisions. In this study, we ask whether insects employ absolute or relative value learning. Using the larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we designed associative odour–taste learning experiments to distinguish both kinds of learning and found that larvae learn about the relative rather than the absolute values of both rewards and punishments, irrespective of the number and sequence of training trials. This suggests that relative value learning is a facility shared across the animal kingdom from maggots to humans and can be accomplished even by small insect brains.

Cryptic species have important implications for ecology, evolution and conservation. For example, morphology-based species of limited conservation concern can contain cryptic species that are in imminent danger of extinction. Here, we examined the prevalence of cryptic species across vertebrates. We also examined the controversial use of mitochondrial data, and whether they overestimate or underestimate cryptic species relative to nuclear data. We obtained usable estimates of species limits from 373 studies. We found that each morphology-based species contained approximately two cryptic species on average. This number was surprisingly similar across major groups despite dramatic differences in ecology and physiology (fishes versus birds), and similar to comparable estimates in insects. Cryptic species numbers from mitochondrial data alone were often higher than from nuclear data, but were generally not statistically different. Overall, our results show that cryptic species are numerous and widespread across vertebrates.

Temperate mesophotic ecosystems (TMEs; 30–150 m) are light-dependent habitats that generally experience cooler and more stable temperatures than adjacent shallow zones, potentially leading to intraspecific differences in thermal tolerance between shallow and mesophotic populations. Sponges, often the dominant benthic organisms in TMEs, show varied responses to thermal stress. We hypothesized that shallow-water sponges may be more resilient to heat stress than conspecifics from upper-mesophotic depths. To test this, we exposed Rowella lancifera sponges from one shallow and one upper-mesophotic population to a simulated MHW and measured respiration, buoyant weight, mortality and microbial community composition. Temperature records from the preceding year confirmed cooler, more stable conditions at upper-mesophotic depths. Sponges displayed strong stress responses under MHW exposure, resulting in high mortality, but responses did not differ between depths. Elevated respiration rates also coincided with microbial community shifts. Overall, our results indicate that a 1°C increase above previous MHW peaks could cause widespread mortality in R. lancifera.",,,0.0,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.1103

H. Barrett; Alison M. Derry,"Abstract The persistence of populations facing severe environmental disturbance can be enabled by natural selection on heritable phenotypic variation—a process known as evolutionary rescue. Few studies have documented this process or its long-term consequences in complex natural environments. Here, we used copepod resting eggs of Leptodiaptomus minutus from three time periods of lake ecological history, spanning approximately 200 generations (100 years) in two populations impacted by historical acidification. Whole genome sequencing of the resting eggs revealed significant allele frequency shifts associated with the acidification, followed by pH recovery. We used a resurrection ecology approach to retrace adaptive shifts concomitant with environmental transitions. Copepods from the pre-acidification period showed sensitivity to acidity, while individuals from the acidification period were adapted to acidic pH. This tolerance was subsequently lost during pH recovery, implying an adaptive reversal. Demographic models indicated a decline during the acidification process, followed by population recovery based on historical data, suggesting that selection led to evolutionary rescue.

Social insect castes, primarily determined by differential gene expression, exhibit pronounced phenotypic differences in morphology, life history traits and behaviour. In some ants, parasites induce divergent phenotypes, but the role of DNA methylation in this remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined DNA methylation patterns across different tissues (brain and fat body) and castes (queens and workers) in the ant Temnothorax nylanderi. We also compared healthy workers with those infected with the cestode Anomotaenia brevis, which is associated with changes in lifespan, morphology and behaviour. Our results reveal significant differences in gene body methylation across tissues, which were positively linked to gene expression. We also observed caste-specific differences in DNA methylation, particularly in the fat body. Surprisingly, however, we detected no differences in DNA methylation between cestode-infected and healthy workers, despite pronounced differences in transcriptional activity, suggesting that other epigenetic mechanisms exert stronger regulatory control over parasite-induced transcriptional changes. The pronounced differences in DNA methylation between tissues and castes, partly associated with transcriptional variation, warrant further investigation into their functional role, including the modulation of alternative splicing.",,,0.0,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2483

We provide a general framework that conceptualizes the dynamics of selection on phenotypic plasticity in labile dichotomous traits, which commonly shape behaviour and life history. Specifically, we highlight distinctions between selection on expressed plasticity and selection on resulting phenotypes, effects of phenotypic switches in opposite directions, and the full selection dynamics emerging across temporal sequences of environmental conditions. To enact this framework, we quantified selection on early-life plasticity in the ecologically critical trait of seasonal migration versus residence, by fitting a novel multi-state model to spatio-seasonal resighting data from 13 newly fledged cohorts of partially migratory European shags (Gulosus aristotelis). We demonstrate strong and consistent directional selection against early-life plasticity, manifested as substantially lower juvenile survival after phenotypic switches from resident to migrant, but not after reverse switches from migrant to resident. Yet, evident short-term costs translated into weaker and fluctuating selection on plasticity given sequences of phenotypes expressed throughout initial months. We thereby reveal how complex forms of selection against early-life plasticity can arise yet be rapidly attenuated in nature.",,,0.0,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.1063

One pollinator behaviour of particular importance is flower constancy, the tendency to temporarily focus on one flower species during a foraging trip, thereby promoting cross-pollination. The costs and benefits of flower constancy for plants and pollinators are varied, complex and far from understood. This review aims to synthesize studies spanning the last decades, from both plant and pollinator perspectives. Flower constancy is often viewed as an epiphenomenon of pollinator cognition, but there is increasing recognition that pollinators show remarkable behavioural flexibility in their flower choice, often in response to ecological and social factors. Plants usually benefit from flower constancy, which reduces pollen loss and interspecific pollen transfer. However, in some situations, pollinator inconstancy can be advantageous owing to increased visits from pollinators shared with co-flowering plants, a process called facilitation. The fitness consequences of pollinator behaviour for rare or invasive plants are intriguing yet little understood, with important implications for plant conservation. Rather than seeing flower constancy as a strategy imposed on pollinators by cognitive constraints, this review emphasises that plants and pollinators pursue varied agendas depending on their ecological context and lifestyle.",,,0.0,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2103

While its impacts on biological and ecological processes are well documented among terrestrial taxa, marine organisms have received less attention, though a quarter of the world’s coastlines are affected by artificial light at night. Furthermore, the intergenerational effects of artificial light at night have never been documented in the wild. We conducted a field manipulation experiment in the lagoon of Mo’orea, French Polynesia, using LED (Light-Emitting Diode) lights to test artificial light at night’s effects on adult life-history and offspring fitness of the coral reef anemonefish Amphiprion chrysopterus. Exposing adults and embryos to LEDs, we found artificial light at night enhanced adult growth but did not alter measured reproductive traits, including fecundity. We observed reduced parental reproductive hormone levels with downstream consequences for offspring. Hatching success was unchanged, but offspring showed reduced embryonic heart rate and yolk sac size, and drastically diminished larval escape responses and swimming performance. This comprehensive study is the first in a wild organism to demonstrate combined intergenerational and direct negative effects of artificial light at night, highlighting limited compensatory capacity. These impacts could impair larval recruitment and hinder population replenishment in reef fish.

This is particularly concerning in the Brazilian Amazon, where anthropogenic disturbances are driving species loss. Our study focused on sarcosaprophagous flies, a group with key roles in public health and ecosystem functioning. Using 8244 occurrence records of flies and machine learning, we mapped knowledge distribution at three levels: families, the best-sampled species and a null model simulating chance knowledge probability. Analyses revealed substantial biases. Sampling was uneven, with approximately 40% of forested areas showing &amp;lt;10% probability of occurrence for families and species, while 80% of the region aligned with null expectations. Knowledge probability increased with accessibility, and species were better documented in degraded areas, exceeding chance expectations, whereas remote areas of high conservation value, including Quilombola territories, were neglected. These patterns were consistent across taxonomic levels, highlighting that addressing knowledge biases requires more than increasing research effort.

These factors do not operate in isolation, and nowhere is their interaction more apparent than in urban environments. Urban organisms rapidly evolve under novel ecological circumstances where they also encounter anthropogenic opportunities for range expansion. We examine the role of urbanization in the invasive success of the spotted lanternfly, an emerging global pest, during its colonization and expansion. We demonstrate that the invasive population in the United States has undergone three sequential bottlenecks, resulting in significantly reduced genetic diversity and elevated inbreeding. The success of this invasive population may be partly attributable to adaptation in the native range before the invasion. We detect divergence between urban and rural lanternflies in Shanghai, China (the invasion origin), in genes related to stress response, metabolism and detoxification pathways. Additionally, we detect genomic signatures of selection in the invasive population, suggesting adaptive refinement as the invasion progresses. This study provides evidence of adaptive evolution in response to urbanization despite substantial loss of genetic diversity and implicates adaptive responses to pesticide application, dietary shifts, and climate in the invasive success of the spotted lanternfly.",,,0.0,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2292

As a consequence, mating and reproductive success is typically more variable in males (Bateman’s principles). However, Charles Darwin already mused that some species may defy these principles, resulting in stronger sexual selection in females than males, but empirical evidence has been mixed. We studied the potential for sexual selection in two sympatric coucals—a bird family with high sex-role variability. In sex-role-reversed black coucals, females compete for territories while males provide parental care. In white-browed coucals, sex roles are flexible. Females of both species had steeper Bateman gradients than males, suggesting females benefit from multiple mating. Male black coucals benefitted from sneaking copulations with their social mate while she prepared clutches for other mates—a male strategy not conceptually included in Bateman’s principles that focuses on the number of mating partners, but not on increasing reproductive success by repeatedly mating with the same partner. Our findings support reversed Bateman’s principles, with females having a higher potential for sexual selection than males. Sex-role flexibility allows females to secure additional mates and emancipate themselves from parental care, and it allows males to invest in parental care and emancipate themselves from pre-copulatory competition.",,,0.0,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2860

While ethological research focused on strong innate biases, recent empirical evidence shows that early preferences are often weak, transient and variable. After reviewing these findings, we introduce a novel model that explains how multiple weak biases can support adaptive choices in naive, inexperienced animals. We propose a self-supervised strategy in which naive animals combine internal predispositions with environmental structure to guide behaviour. First, predispositions target features that are rare in the background but common in relevant stimuli (e.g. red colour, upward movement), thus reducing false positives. Second, the evolution of multiple weak biases allows animals to increase accuracy of decisions using co-occurring cues (e.g. colour, sound and movement). Weak biases are advantageous as they prevent strong responses to misleading partial matches. Requiring the co-occurrence of multiple rare cues supports effective choices in complex environments with many misleading stimuli. This simple self-supervised strategy offers a new framework for understanding early decision-making, with implications that span across behavioural ecology, developmental psychology, comparative cognition and artificial intelligence, where decision-making with sparse evidence is a crucial challenge.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.1878

One of these invasive species is the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), a fish introduced into fresh and brackish waters around the world. To understand how round gobies perform if they continue spreading into higher-salinity oceans, we investigated how individuals differ in physiological and behavioural (co)sensitivity to salinity changes. We measured growth, metabolic rates, activity, dispersal and exploration of 59 individuals in the lab after acclimation to salinities ranging from freshwater to seawater (0, 10, 19, 24 and 28 ppt), and quantified trait variation and sensitivity to salinity as reaction norm intercepts and slopes. The fastest-growing individuals at 10 ppt—the salinity the fish were caught at—were also the most active and explorative at this salinity and thus more likely to spread. However, above 15 ppt, these individuals lost their growth advantage and experienced the most severe reductions in aerobic capacity (maximum metabolic rate and aerobic scope). As growth and aerobic capacity are linked to survival and performance in nature, this cross-over at 15 ppt is likely to determine the phenotypic composition of round goby populations across salinities and their continued invasion success and ecological impact.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2937

In this study, we combine food web modelling with causal inference to quantify causal effects between marine mammals and commercially important fish species in the Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. We first extract multiple food web dynamics from an existing mass-balanced linear inverse food web model and use these as inputs to causal modelling. A key methodological step is to translate the food web network into a temporally explicit causal diagram. By mapping biomass flows onto causal links, we quantify causal effects for both the short term (1 year lag) and the long term (30 year simulation). We find that the increase in marine mammal biomass has predominantly negative and potentially large—but highly uncertain—effects on fish biomass. In contrast, an increase in fish biomass produces smaller, positive effects on marine mammals. Long-term simulations reveal dampened impacts, indicating partial compensation over time. The results from this study, which combines food web dynamics modelling with causal inference, can support more precise, data-informed and ecologically grounded fisheries and marine mammal management in the North Atlantic.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2363
80,The interplay of sexual selection and hybridization can drive sexual radiation,,,,,0.0,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,A,ecology,Kotaro Kagawa,"Abstract Many evolutionary radiations involve diversification of exaggerated sexual displays, but little is known about how they are formed. It has been theorized that there can be multiple stable equilibria in the evolution of sexually selected traits, by which multiple species having distinct sexual displays and mate preferences can stably persist. However, these theories alone do not fully explain the speciation process because the stability of each equilibrium will impede the formation of a new species from an existing species that is already occupying one of the stable equilibria. To explain the evolutionary process that forms species with diverse sexual displays, we here propose that hybridization between phenotypically similar but genetically divergent lineages can catalyse speciation by sexual selection, via the creation of genotypic and phenotypic variation. Using evolutionary simulations, we show that hybridization giving rise to variation in mate preference and sexual displays can alter the sexual selection regime, thereby creating opportunities for evolutionary shifts towards previously unoccupied stable equilibria. Thus, hybridization can facilitate evolutionary exploration of the stable evolutionary equilibria that sexual selection generates, leading to speciation accompanied by the diversification of exaggerated sexual displays.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2605

Carlos R. Hernandez-Beltran; Michael Schwarz; Paul B. Rainey,"Abstract Adaptive evolution often leads to niche specialization, but successful colonization of a new niche can depend as much on ecological context as on genetic change. This is especially true in spatially structured environments, where the construction of habitat and order of arrival of mutants shape evolutionary outcomes. In static broth cultures, the air–liquid interface (ALI) provides a high-oxygen niche typically colonized by mat-forming strategists. In Pseudomonas fluorescens, single mutations that upregulate cellulose production give rise to ‘wrinkly spreader’ (WS) types—canonical niche specialists that out-compete ancestral types at the ALI. Here, we show that this view can be refined: WS mutants often fail to establish when introduced alone at low density, but co-culture with ancestral types rescues colonization. Microscopy and simulations reveal that ancestral types physically scaffold the ALI, enabling attachment and facilitating the in situ emergence of diverse WS mutants. Ancestral types later disperse, allowing WS expansion. This transient asymmetric interaction shows that even strongly adaptive mutations may rely on ecological facilitation.

Ranger; Antonio Gugliuzzo; Juan Carlos Cambronero-Heinrichs; Davide Rassati,"Abstract Ambrosia beetle gallery systems are typically excavated into the xylem of host trees by a single mated female and are generally considered to function as independent units. However, field observations suggest that interactions among gallery systems may also occur. Using X-ray tomography to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of ambrosia beetle galleries in flood-stressed and ethanol-injected trees, we found that intersections, where two or more galleries excavated by different females merge at one or more points, and intrusions, where a female begins excavating her gallery from within a gallery previously abandoned by another female of a larger species, are recurrent phenomena. We also observed that intraspecific intersections were generally more frequent than interspecific ones, regardless of tree treatment. These intraspecific intersections may represent a potential mechanism for cross-fertilization among the offspring of different founding females, thereby potentially increasing opportunities for outbreeding in these otherwise inbreeding species. Interspecific intersections, which could potentially facilitate lateral transfer of symbionts, occurred less frequently than expected, suggesting that ambrosia beetles may actively avoid such interactions.

Here, we apply synchrotron radiation techniques to Jamoytius and Lasanius, two soft-bodied Silurian vertebrates, key taxa for discerning vertebrate bone evolution owing to highly localized, but debated, biomineralization. We map soft-tissue structures and quantify details of biochemical residue impossible to resolve with traditional methods. We present the first unequivocal evidence for biomineralized apatitic scales in Jamoytius by combining synchrotron rapid scanning X-ray fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (elevated Ca 37% and P 21%). This approach also recovers robust evidence for apatitic biomineralization in Lasanius. Chemical mapping of the optical anatomy of Jamoytius recovers a close correlation with Zn and Cu distribution, providing evidence for a retinal pigmented epithelium and complex eyes. In both taxa, chemical maps reveal original anatomical details not apparent in visible light, including potential evidence of other sensory anatomy in Jamoytius.

The small population paradigm suggests such declines increase genetic load and extinction risk. However, some species recover rapidly from severe bottlenecks, indicating possible alternative outcomes. To investigate, we compared population genomic characteristics of the black-necked crane before and after a recent bottleneck. Modern genomes showed reduced diversity, intensified inbreeding and a greater realized genetic load compared with historical genomes, confirming the impact of an abrupt bottleneck during the 1980s. Our analyses also revealed that purifying selection remained efficient during this period, as indicated by the relative purging of highly deleterious alleles within runs of homozygosity and a consistent signal of strong evolutionary constraint at highly conserved homozygous sites. This persistence of purifying selection may have mitigated the severity of inbreeding depression. Thus, rapid demographic recovery can coincide with ongoing purifying selection, potentially preventing a short-term extinction vortex.

Brimmed trilobites were diverse and widespread, but we still do not fully understand why the harpiform brim evolved or what role it played in their success. Many authors have speculated about the brim’s function, generating many untested hypotheses. We tested the hypothesis that the brim evolved to prevent sinking in soft sediments by calculating the depth to which brimless trilobites would sink and showed this explanation to be untenable. We then three-dimensionally printed model cephala with various brim shapes and moved them through natural sediments, testing the hypothesis that the brim evolved as a sediment plough. We found that increased horizontal brim width allowed a cephalon to efficiently displace more sediment, while increased brim height merely impeded the cephalon’s progress. However, there is no clear evolutionary trend among harpetids or trinucleids towards wider or flatter brims, indicating that ploughing did not exert a strong selective pressure on brimmed trilobites.

However, it remains unclear whether these factors alone explain the observed seasonality, and why some bat–virus systems with similar reproductive phenology exhibit more complex dynamics. Here, Bayesian methods were used to calibrate four seasonally forced mechanistic models of coronavirus dynamics in a Cambodian fruit bat (Pteropus lylei) population.

Using telemetry data from 125 Eurasian lynx (172 lynx-years, 1995–2023) across Europe, we investigated sex-specific spatio-temporal patterns and drivers of these excursions during the mating season. Overall, 33% of males and 11% of females undertook excursions, with males having higher rates than females. Male excursions mostly occurred in March, coinciding with the peak of the conception period, while females tended to undertake excursions either before or after this peak. The median Euclidean distance travelled beyond the home range was 6.8 km for males and 2.6 km for females, with corresponding median durations of 119 h and 85 h, respectively. Translocated individuals exhibited higher excursion rates than those in established populations, suggesting mate-searching in novel environments. We found no evidence that human influences affected excursion rates or distances. Our findings highlight a mating tactic that is often overlooked and provide new insight into sex-specific and context-dependent movement strategies in Eurasian lynx. By linking extra-territorial excursions to reproduction patterns, our study informs future research on mate-searching behaviour in felids and offers implications for conservation planning, particularly in isolated or reintroduced populations.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2235

Haynie; Claire Bowern; Robert K. Colwell; Simon J. Greenhill; Kathryn R. Kirby; Thiago Rangel; Michael C. Gavin,"Abstract Humans collectively use thousands of languages. The number of languages in a region (i.e. ‘richness’) varies widely. Empirical research has identified social, environmental, geographic and demographic factors associated with language richness. However, our understanding of causal mechanisms and variation in their effects over space has been limited by prior analyses focusing on correlation and assuming stationarity. Here we use process-based, spatially explicit stochastic models to simulate the emergence, expansion, contraction, fragmentation and extinction of language ranges. We varied parameter settings in these computer-simulated experiments to evaluate the extent to which different processes reproduce observed patterns of language richness in North America. We find that the majority of spatial variation in language richness is explained by models in which environmental and social constraints determine population density, random shocks alter population sizes more frequently at higher population densities, and population shocks are more frequently negative than positive. Language diversification occurs when populations split after reaching size limits, and when ranges fragment due to population contractions following negative shocks or due to contact with other groups expanding following positive shocks. These findings support theories arguing that environmental and social conditions, constraints on group sizes, outcomes of contact and shifting demographics all shape language richness.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2024.2361

In long-lived species, early-life phenotypic changes can have profound consequences if they persist into adulthood. Understanding the balance between stable and flexible trait expression across ontogeny is therefore key. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are central to physiological regulation and known to exhibit plasticity, but little is known about the consistency of GC phenotypes across development. We examined whether bonobos (Pan paniscus), a long-lived species, show consistent GC phenotypes as they mature, focusing on individual differences in average urinary cortisol phenotypes (reaction-norm intercepts) and plasticity (reaction-norm slopes) in response to time of day. We applied a reaction-norm approach to assess individual variation in GC intercepts and slopes across ontogeny, using random regression mixed-effects models. Trait repeatability of urinary cortisol was low across and within years, indicating high within-individual variation relative to between-individual variation. Reaction-norm intercepts were moderately repeatable, suggesting stable individual average GC phenotypes across development. By contrast, slopes were weakly repeatable, reflecting flexibility in how individuals modulate GC output across the day. This dual regulatory structure may support adaptive physiological responses to changing demands in a long-lived species.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2675

Scott; Owen O’Connor,"Abstract Mammalian males’ strategies for obtaining resources have been well-established and typically depend on direct contests that produce hierarchies. Although less well-documented, current evidence suggests that in female philopatric communities, females engage in contests often with coalition partners who are typically female kin. When kin are not present, however, females of similar age appear more egalitarian and tend to avoid contests. To examine whether phylogenetically similar sex-biased strategies to obtain valuable resources occur in humans, we held a contest for 50 pairs of unrelated, familiar 3–7-year-old children from diverse backgrounds. We show that the majority of female pairs spontaneously approached the resources side-by-side, then briefly competed to obtain the resources. In marked contrast, in over half of the male pairs, one male deferred to his partner, who then gained unimpeded access to the most valuable resource. Sex-differentiated strategies, however, appeared only with same-sex peers. Results show that already by early childhood, humans exhibit sex-biased strategies to regulate competition between same-sex peers. Sex-segregated peer groups, however, mean that by adulthood, each sex has practised strikingly different strategies for obtaining resources from same-sex peers.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2558

Morales; Marcelo A. Aizen,"Abstract The lower mean yield of organic farming compared with conventional agriculture raises questions about its economic viability. However, its relatively mild impact on insect populations, combined with bottom-up benefits of organic soil amendments, may strengthen plant–pollinator interactions and enhance pollination services. Because pollination often limits the yield of most pollinator-dependent crops, high-quality pollination services could mitigate the yield drawbacks commonly associated with organic farming practices. Using a dataset comprising 1372 individual records from 199 studies and 61 crop species, we conducted a meta-analysis to test whether the yield gap between conventional and organic agriculture decreases with increasing crop pollinator dependence. We explicitly accounted for two potential confounding factors—climatic zone of crop origin and crop growth form—and implicitly for additional phylogenetically structured traits. We found that the yield gap narrows with increasing pollinator dependence, becoming negligible for crops with moderate to high reliance on pollinators. This relationship remained robust after controlling for confounding factors and publication bias. Our findings suggest that organic management may be preferable for pollinator-dependent crops, often achieving yields comparable to conventional farming while reducing ecological costs. These results highlight the potential of pollinator-friendly practices to reconcile productivity and sustainability in agricultural systems.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2553

Eskew; Erin Clancey; Deepti Singh; Silvia Situma; Luke Nyakarahuka; M. Kariuki Njenga; Scott L. Nuismer,"Abstract Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic disease that causes sporadic, multi-country epidemics. However, there is limited understanding of RVF virus circulation during interepidemic periods and the potential impacts of global change on interepidemic RVF. To address these knowledge gaps, we built a predictive model using recent interepidemic RVF outbreak data from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. We then projected interepidemic RVF risk for three future time periods (2021–2040, 2041–2060, 2061–2080) under three global change scenarios representing different trajectories for climate and human population distribution (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370). Our model identified interepidemic RVF risk hotspots in east Kenya, east Tanzania and southwest Uganda. Hydrology was a major driver of disease risk: hotspots emerged in association with lakes and rivers, and risk peaked during May–July following the long rains season (March–May). Projections under global change scenarios suggested that disease risk will generally decrease over time. Nevertheless, owing to expected human population growth, we estimate that &amp;gt; 90 million people in the study region will be exposed to interepidemic RVF by 2061–2080, which is nearly double the historical (1970–2000) estimate of approximately 49 million people.

This study examined how functional richness and functional redundancy influenced the stability of two key ecological functions—insect predation and seed dispersal—in forest bird communities with contrasting histories of cyclone exposure. Using total biomass of insectivores and frugivores as functional indicators, we found that the stability of insect predation increased with redundancy in function-delivering traits under cyclone disturbances, whereas the stability of seed dispersal was enhanced by redundancy in both function-delivering and response-related traits. In forests frequently exposed to cyclones, both functional groups occupied a smaller overall trait space, while frugivores showed greater trait similarity among individuals. These results suggest that the stability in insect predation and seed dispersal largely stems from the abundance of species performing similar functional roles. High cyclone frequency appears to exclude species with extreme traits and concentrate functional space around a few dominant species with convergent traits. Because such convergence buffers cyclone impacts, the loss of even a few redundant species could increase functional uniqueness and, consequently, reduce the functional stability of forest bird communities.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2679

While bulk RNA-sequencing has been instrumental in identifying strongly sex-biased genes, it lacks resolution to assess variation across cell-types and tissue compartments. Using single-nucleus expression data from the Fly Cell Atlas, we investigate sex differences in adult Drosophila melanogaster. We find that differences in cell-type composition between the sexes are not a major source of sex-bias, as for the vast majority of genes, the degree of sex-bias is similar regardless of whether sex differences in cell-type composition are controlled for or not. Our analysis confirms a deficit of X-linked male-biased genes in the body’s somatic tissues that is widespread across cell-types. We also find the excess of X-linked female-biased genes to be associated with nervous system cells in the head but with epithelial cells in the body’s somatic tissues, showing that single-nucleus data crucially resolves sex-bias at the cell-type level. We investigate dosage compensation (DC) across 15 tissues and 17 cell-types. We observe that it varies throughout the body. Surprisingly, we observe a lack of DC in a cluster of main cells within the male accessory glands.

Bauch,"Abstract Metapopulation models are among the most frequently used approaches to address spatial heterogeneity in infectious disease modelling. While researchers typically consider the role of heterogeneity in disease transmission by dividing the population into subgroups according to levels of social activity, susceptibility or perceived risk of infection, the role of heterogeneity in vaccination behaviour has received less attention. The tendency to interact with others who share similar beliefs (homophily) can further reinforce such heterogeneity, leading to clustered vaccine sentiments in the population. In this paper, we develop a multi-group vaccination game model coupled with an SIRV epidemic model and examine how interactions among individuals within and between groups affect both vaccination behaviour and disease dynamics. We find that in a three-group system with extremely pro- and anti-vaccine groups, each group can converge to a partially pro-vaccine equilibrium, causing population-level opinion polarization that can persist despite the severity of the disease. Our results highlight the dual role of homophily, offer insights into the design of effective public health interventions and demonstrate the potential of a multi-group framework in real-world disease modelling.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2530

Although international treaties and health recommendations call for banning hazardous pesticides, globally harmonized pesticide governance remains elusive. In Latin America (LATAM), the main net food exporter worldwide, agricultural pesticide use has increased by approximately 500% since 1990, compared with only approximately 3% in Europe. To assess the environmental and health rigour of LATAM’s pesticide legislation, we reviewed active ingredients (AIs) approved for ten major crops, and AIs banned at national level, in eight LATAM countries, assessed their hazardousness according to international standards, and legal status in the European Union (EU) and explored sources of variation in the number of AIs approved in LATAM. We identified 523 AIs approved and 236 banned in LATAM; approximately 50% of the approved and approximately 85% of the banned AIs in LATAM were either not approved or prohibited in the EU. Higher crop production and, to a lesser extent, export value were linked to more AIs approved in LATAM. These findings imply weaker regulatory frameworks for hazardous pesticides in LATAM, reflecting more permissive environmental policies compared with the EU.

NIBS using rhythmic sensory stimuli entrains brain oscillations and synchronizes functional networks, but the choice of NIBS frequency to enhance performance in cognitive tasks remains unclear. We adopt a network neuroscience approach to NIBS, linking network connectivity, EEG oscillatory frequencies and behavioural performance to test the effects of personalized rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) on an inhibitory control task (Simon task) in older adults aged 60–75 years. Simon task trials were preceded by ≈1.7–3.2 s of personalized RAS (clicks) at each individual’s theta oscillation frequency (fθ), a slightly faster variant (fθ+), a fixed low-frequency control at 2 Hz (f2Hz) or a non-rhythmic control (NR). Reaction times (RTs) after personalized stimulation were faster than f2Hz and NR, with stronger brain entrainment to rhythmic stimulation linked to faster RTs. Task-related EEG signals showed enhanced attentional processes and more efficient cortical responses following the personalized stimulation. Individuals with lower baseline performance had the greatest benefits. The findings suggest personalized RAS enhances cognitive performance in ageing and provides a cost-effective neurorehabilitation approach to mitigate age-related cognitive decline.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.1857

We report estimates of muscle-specific changes in metabolic demands and contraction conditions for key muscles, including the hamstrings, uniarticular hip extensors and plantar flexors, reflecting the complex interplay between kinetic demands and muscle energetics. Our results show that leaning forward reduces knee extension moments but involves metabolic cost trade-offs.

However, research on whether and how animals adjust their group spatial structure when they encounter or spatially co-occur with a different group remains limited. We investigated how non-territorial units in feral horse multilevel societies manage spatial encounters with neighbouring units. We observed 25 reproductive units in northern Portugal, using drones, and employed statistical analyses to quantify spatial dynamics. We found that horses actively adjusted their spatial formations depending on the proximity of other units. Units became more circular and cohesive when other units approached, but when extremely close, they elongated their shapes to avoid boundary crossings. These adjustments indicate that horses maintain flexible unit boundaries to prevent mixing with other units. A notable exception was a particular pair of units that frequently crossed boundaries and intermixed, representing a unique social level within the horse multilevel society. Overall, our findings indicate that feral horses respond adaptively to inter-unit encounters by balancing the benefits of aggregation with the need to reduce direct overlap, providing new insights into the spatial organization of non-territorial societies.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2468

Haron; Marc Wilhelm Holderied; Shane Windsor,"Abstract Echolocating bats moving through natural habitats have to analyse many overlapping echoes that change dynamically in real-time. In increasingly complex natural scenarios, tracking individual echo sources becomes untenable, requiring alternative analytical approaches. Here, we test whether wild free-ranging bats use acoustic flow (analogous to optic flow) velocity for speed control. Acoustic flow presents a viable navigational concept in complex scenarios because indicators of acoustic flow velocity are accessible from single calls as temporal modulations in flight-induced Doppler shift in the habitat echo. Using a conveyor belt system of 8000 acoustic reflectors (artificial leaves) lining 4 m of a natural bat flight corridor, we tracked how bats adjusted their flight velocity to induced changes in acoustic flow velocity. When we increased acoustic flow velocity by moving reflectors against the bats’ flight direction, bats flew significantly slower by up to 28% of the induced decrease and faster when reflectors moved in their flight direction. Bats adjusted their flight velocity as they approached the moving panels, matching the spatial pattern of increasing Doppler shift, suggesting this may be the parameter they are responding to. Navigation by Doppler acoustic flow can inspire future autonomous navigation techniques, mirroring optic flow.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2481

The altered abiotic conditions and biotic interactions in urban habitats impose divergent selection pressures on urban versus rural populations, while genetic drift may also be significant in typically small urban populations. A key question in urban evolution concerns the origin and spread of urban genotypes.

Here, we address genetic differentiation among urban populations, among rural populations, and between urban and rural populations. We conducted an extensive population genomic double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing analysis of two non-model grassland lepidopterans, Coenonympha pamphilus and Chiasmia clathrata, across Europe. The genetic population structures of the study species were strikingly different: Co. pamphilus showed strong population differentiation, while this was almost absent in Ch. clathrata, which instead showed signs of high current and past gene flow among populations. The results of Co. pamphilus are consistent with multiple origins of urban populations, and multiple origins also seem plausible in Ch. clathrata.

We applied an adapted phylogenetic hot node analysis to identify plant lineages significantly rich in useful species across each use category and region, thereby revealing cross-cultural patterns of plant use and enlarging the potential of the method beyond bioprospecting. We found overlap between lineages used for food and medicine, and between condiments and medicine, both across and within regions. Condiments, often classified as food, had a higher overlap with medicinal plants, reinforcing the idea that they play a critical role in bridging nutrition and health.

Increasingly, predictive conservation studies are investigating behaviour, life history and ecology to identify predictors of species extinction risk. Most studies predict species with larger body masses are at a higher risk of extinction. However, this relationship is known to be mediated by species’ life histories and ecology. We investigated their role in explaining variation in the body mass–extinction risk relationship of bird species at the regional scale. We compiled data and constructed phylogenetic generalized linear models for 1213 bird species native to India to test hypotheses to predict extinction risk based on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List threatened status. We assessed potential predictors of extinction probability, including birds’ survival and reproductive life-history traits, ecology and their interactions with body mass. We found habitat density preference, hand-wing index or wing pointedness that indicates dispersal ability and migratory behaviour modulated the positive body mass–extinction risk relationship. Small clutch size was also a predictor of high extinction risk.

Here, we investigate using agent-based models how a propensity for early exploration in childhood contributes to cultural adaptation and the evolution of long human childhood. Using a complex cultural task, we implemented a two-stage strategy for exploring this space—children explore broadly, and are more likely to learn new behaviours, while adults exploit behaviours already known, incrementally improving them. We found that populations that followed this two-stage strategy achieved higher payoffs in the long term than populations using the two exploration strategies in a random order. Our models point at a ‘just right’ length of childhood—neither too long, nor too short—allowing individuals enough time to explore before exploiting what they learned. Social learning increased payoffs when agents could copy individuals of a variety of ages, but reduced the benefit of early exploration. Payoffs decreased under environmental change, especially for long childhoods, because adults did not have enough time to recover between bouts of change.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2122

This study focuses on intermediate hosts of intestinal schistosomes, with over 700 million people at risk of lifelong infection. We compared habitat suitability and species interactions across 674 sites in 52 villages in rural Uganda between 2022 and 2024, capturing a severe flooding event. Spatiotemporal models incorporating a polygon-based method to account for space with time as a fixed effect were developed to analyse snail abundance for Biomphalaria sudanica and B. stanleyi. B. sudanica was associated with marshy sites near lake shorelines and presence of hyacinths, while B. stanleyi was more likely to be found in deeper waters with Vallisneria plants. However, cohabitation was common for both species. Habitat suitability for each species fluctuated temporally, and more starkly with extreme flooding, resulting in switching of species dominance. Our study suggests that events consistent with climate change may influence habitat suitability without necessitating an expansion of environmental areas.

For polar seabirds, non-breeding phases like moult remain understudied, despite their importance for survival and overall fitness. Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) replace their highly specialized feathers during an approximately 19-day annual moult, typically carried out while fasting on sea ice. The required fast and elevated metabolic rate may create a significant energetic bottleneck. We analysed data from geolocating dive recorders deployed on known-age Adélie penguins and non-known-age pairs from two Ross Island colonies over three winters (2017–2019). Moult start date was influenced by breeding success, intrinsic factors (age, sex) and extrinsic factors (year), with males, older birds and successful breeders moulting later. Moult duration varied primarily with individual ID, though later initiation correlated with shorter duration, particularly when located further south. Moult duration was longer in the western Ross Sea, a region that was used exclusively by males. The association between moult start date and duration may lead to differential sex and breeding status effects, with older males more likely to face a trade-off between successful breeding and self-maintenance tasks like feather replacement.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.1838

Ezenwa,"Abstract Highly coordinated animal groups such as schooling fish, migrating birds and swarming insects are ubiquitous in nature, and these complex displays of collective behaviour emerge from local interactions between individuals. Although collective behaviours are known to confer benefits, they also come with the standard costs of group living, including increased risk of parasite infection. Notably, parasites can have profound effects on individual behaviour, which may in turn affect the inter-individual interactions that drive collective behaviour. Thus, given the commonness of parasites in animal populations and their widely appreciated effects on animal hosts, parasitism may be a key force shaping the ecology of collective behaviour. In this article, we use information transfer as a unifying theme to explore how the effects of parasites on individuals translate to the collective, focusing on four common collective behaviours: decision-making, collective movement, synchronization and construction. We also discuss the implications of parasite-altered collective behaviour for processes such as parasite transmission, wildlife conservation and animal culture.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.1746

Forrister; Leslie Cayola; Alfredo Fuentes; Belén Alvestegui; Nathan Muchhala; J. Sebastián Tello; Martin Volf; Jonathan A. Myers; Brian E. Sedio,"Abstract Plants interact with their environment through diverse specialized metabolites that protect them from abiotic stressors, like drought or radiation, and biotic stressors, like herbivores or pathogens. However, few studies have considered the chemical properties of metabolites as a potential axis of functional trait variation along environmental gradients. Here, we examined how the chemical properties of foliar metabolomes, such as mean aromaticity, hydrophobicity and polarity, as well as commonly used morphological traits, vary with climate and elevation among 16 forest plots in the tropical Andes of Bolivia. We found that chemical properties were weakly related to morphological traits among tree species, yet both varied significantly with climate and elevation. In particular, abundance-weighted mean hydrophobicity decreased, and polar surface area increased with elevation and in colder and drier climates. Additionally, co-occurring species showed increasing chemical similarity with elevation for the most-aromatic and most-polar metabolites. These results suggest that abiotic stress associated with colder, drier climates and solar radiation acts as a filter for metabolome chemical properties. This contrasts with chemical dissimilarity observed at lower elevations, which is likely driven by pressure from host-specialized enemies in warmer, wetter climates. Our results introduce the possibility that chemical defences may be constrained by abiotic stressors.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.1721

Blier,"Abstract The theory of optimal cell size postulates that cell size imposes constraints on oxygen delivery in larger cells owing to their smaller surface-area-to-volume ratios. Smaller cells, with a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio, have an increased capacity to take up oxygen, which is therefore expected to increase their heat tolerance (CTmax). However, the precise mechanisms linking cell size, body size and heat tolerance remain unclear. We obtained contrasts in cell size by raising diploid and triploid juvenile Daphnia at different temperatures. Daphnia raised at lower temperatures had larger cells than those raised at higher temperatures. Triploid clones had larger cells than diploid clones at 16°C, 20°C and 24°C. CTmax increased with acclimation temperature and was negatively correlated to both cell and body size. Triploid clones had lower CTmax values than both subarctic and temperate diploid clones at 16°C and 20°C. Heat shock significantly increased the expression of Hsp70 and catalase, but these were not correlated with CTmax or ploidy, suggesting that heat tolerance was not directly linked to heat-shock proteins or oxidative stress responses. These findings highlight the role of cell size and polyploidy in shaping the heat tolerance and geographic distribution of ectotherms.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.1537

Magurran; Kartik Shanker,"Abstract Endemic species enrich biodiversity hotspots, but how do they contribute to biodiversity structure at macroecological scales? Here, we argue that classifying endemic species using a framework defined by the complementary axes of taxonomic and functional diversity is key to revealing how these patterns underpin community convergence and divergence. These processes are known to configure communities to be compositionally more similar or dissimilar, respectively. Using the endemic freshwater fish communities of India’s Western Ghats Escarpment (WGE), one of the 'hottest' spots of global biodiversity, as a test case, we find that geographically widespread, trait-distinct endemics are disproportionately present in the west-flowing basins of the WGE where they promote overall convergence (i.e. both taxonomic and functional). In contrast, among east-flowing basins, a lower-than-expected occurrence of the same category of species supports taxonomic divergence and functional convergence. We attribute this heterogeneity to western-flowing basins having higher (i) ecosystem productivity that supports trait-distinctiveness, and (ii) temporary lateral connectivity that facilitates fish dispersal. Our study demonstrates how different dimensions of diversity interact to produce ecological structure, thereby underlining their role in resilience. Thus, this framework has application in conservation and policy and can guide global efforts to protect endemic biodiversity in hotspots.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.1127

In primate research, long-term studies rely on accurate identification and tracking of individuals—a skill often honed by LSs and passed on to international specialists (ISs). Despite growing recognition in publications, LSs’ scientific contributions often remain undervalued. Here, we show that LSs at the Budongo Conservation Field Station (Uganda) reliably extract acoustic information (caller identity, sex and age, call components and production context) from long-distance pant hoot calls produced by wild chimpanzees. Importantly, LSs significantly outperform ISs at identifying individuals (LS accuracy = 50% (95% confidence interval (CI): 45–56%); IS accuracy = 8% (95% CI: 5–11%)), an important skill for recognizing and locating individuals in dense forests. LSs’ performance was positively associated with duration of working experience. Given the limited field time of ISs (typically 1–2 years), LSs’ expertise and longer commitment (mean 16.75 years) represent an essential yet underacknowledged scientific resource. Our study highlights LSs’ critical role in ethological research—not only enhancing skills and data quality, but also potentially helping address both ethical (e.g. community involvement) and environmental (e.g. travel carbon footprint) challenges linked to fieldwork in remote locations.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.0997

It has been proposed that species’ age predicts extinction risk. However, our understanding of age-dependent extinction (ADE) remains unresolved, with positive and negative trends being modelled only as mutually exclusive, and rarely across clade-specific diversification trajectories. Here, we reconstruct the global diversification trajectory of neoselachians (modern sharks and rays) over the past 145 Myr to assess ADE using a new model that allows positive and negative trends to co-occur. We recovered a dynamic diversification trajectory, including four previously undetected extinction events, the most significant in the Eocene–Oligocene. Negative ADE was consistently found over time, with young species, especially those younger than 4 Myr, being more vulnerable. Our results suggest that neoselachians have been more susceptible to extinction than previously recognized, with age being a consistent intrinsic predictor of their vulnerability through deep time.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2272

Wright; Heloise Gibb,"Abstract Lifespan is a key life-history trait that shapes ecological strategies and colony fitness in social insects, yet its drivers remain unclear. We evaluated whether intrinsic traits—especially worker body size, a principal pace-of-life axis and phylogeny—predict survival across 18 ant species from five subfamilies monitored in the field and in captivity. Mark-recapture data analysed with hierarchical models accounting for imperfect detection showed that larger workers lived longer in both environments, highlighting intrinsic physiological properties as the strongest determinant of longevity. Worker lifespans ranged from 23 to 394 days, and field and laboratory survival were positively correlated. Body mass scaled negatively with colony size: small colonies invested in large, long-lived workers, whereas large colonies relied on smaller, short-lived workers. In captivity, survival was modestly higher for some clades and comparable for others, indicating mixed laboratory–field differences consistent with hazard reduction in certain lineages; Dolichoderinae and Myrmicinae showed little to no improvement. Phylogenetic signal was weak, indicating that lineage imposes little constraint beyond body size. These results confirm body size as a strong—and phylogeny as a weak—predictor of worker longevity. Laboratory assays capture relative field lifespans despite environmental complexity, based on the first comparative survival dataset for a local ant assemblage spanning multiple lineages.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.1907

Ridgway; Javier Figueras Jimenez; Beñat Yáñez Iturbe-Ormaeche; Maria Daniela Santos Nunes; Alistair P. McGregor,"Abstract Drosophila ventral appendages are considered to be serially homologous structures derived from a ventral appendage ‘ground state’ and shaped by different Hox inputs. The male and female terminalia (analia and genitalia) are highly derived ventral structures defined by Abdominal-B and the sex-determination pathway. In the legs and antennae, a combination of the transcription factors (TFs) C15, LIM1 homeobox 1 (Lim1) and Aristaless (Al) is required for tarsal claw and arista development, respectively. However, the roles of these TFs in terminalia development remained unexplored. We investigated the expression and function of C15, Lim1 and Al during male and female terminalia development. We found that C15 plays distinct roles in males and females, repressing male clasper bristles while promoting bristles on the female epiproct. Contrasting with antennae and legs, C15, Lim1 and Al are not all simultaneously co-expressed in any terminal structure in either sex, indicating interactions among these factors differ across these appendages. Nevertheless, we inferred interactions between C15 and other factors reflecting similarities between leg and male clasper development. Finally, we identified a male-specific C15 enhancer active in male claspers but not in the female epiproct, legs or antennae. This C15 enhancer modularity may underpin tissue- and sex-specific regulatory logic.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2266

Matson,"Abstract Animals rely on immune defences to counteract pathogens and parasites, but investing in immune defences limits the use of shared resources for other functions. Therefore, the strength of immune defences is hypothesized to be shaped by life history or broader ecology. To better understand ecological and evolutionary patterns in innate humoral immune defences in birds, we compiled more than 400 immunological records of more than 100 avian species from about 100 previous studies that applied a standardized protocol to measure haemolysis and haemagglutination. We extracted data on 15 life-history and ecological variables and built phylogenetically informed comparative models to determine how these variables can explain variation in both immunological indices. We also inferred evolutionary patterns by selecting the best-fitting macroevolutionary models. Our comparative models indicated that several ecological variables, including seasonal stage, sex, age, migration distance, diet type and climatic factors, and only one life-history variable, body mass, were able to explain the immunological variation. The best macroevolutionary models suggest that both immune indices evolved largely through gradual divergence under strong phylogenetic constraints, with evidence for stabilizing selection within Passeriformes. Overall, our results highlight the role of seasonal and demographic pressures, alongside phylogenetic history, in shaping immune variation across avian species.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.1384

Fischer,"Abstract Flexible parental care strategies are widespread in nature and factor into conflict between the sexes and the realization of sex roles. While adaptive explanations abound, the mechanisms underlying flexible ‘sex-reversal’ of care are less clear. We enlist a biparental frog (Ranitomeya imitator) with flexible parental care to investigate the extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms underpinning parental decisions. Using mate removal experiments in the laboratory, we show that members of the primary caregiving sex (males) show less variation than the flexible sex (females) in their propensity to provide care and that care propensity in females is affected by extrinsic partner cues as well as individual variability. Indeed, individual repeatability in parental effort is high in both typically caregiving and flexible parents. To investigate the underpinnings of differences in care propensity, we sequenced RNA from whole brains of caregiving and non-caregiving frogs of both sexes. While actively caregiving females showed minimal differential gene expression compared to actively caregiving males, females that failed to provide care showed distinct patterns of gene expression. Our findings offer an initial glimpse into the environmental and genetic regulation of individual variation in sex-reversed parental care.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2200

Using a newly released French database on pesticide purchases, we investigated their relationship with bird abundances. We first validated that purchase data reflects environmental contamination by comparison with independent data on pesticide residues in surface waters. We then related the local purchases of 242 active substances to the abundance of 64 common bird species in croplands. Pesticide quantities correlated negatively with the abundance of 84.4% of the species, while we accounted for other aspects of agricultural intensification. We obtained similar results with a more integrative pesticide metric, combining quantity, toxicity and degradability of the substances.

Duckworth,"Abstract Evolution requires flexibility, needed for exploration and adjustment, and stability, needed for function. In development, these conflicting requirements are met by regulatory complexes of factors that can transiently reassemble into functional groups at each successive context. Two hallmarks of these complexes—interchangeability and accessibility of binding partners—implicate intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) as likely key organizers. We test whether the binding plasticity of IDPs and their capacity to sustain phase-separated regulatory assemblies can reconcile developmental continuity with microevolutionary divergence in avian beak primordia. We found that the axes of the core regulatory network governing shifts between mechanical states of homogeneous cells in early development align with population divergence in this regulatory network, a pattern produced by IDPs’ dosage-dependent binding plasticity. This disorder-enhanced connectivity converts the stochastic variation in protein concentration at each transition into discrete network configurations, resetting regulatory specializations and promoting plasticity and population divergence. Comparative analyses of avian proteomes confirm that binding promiscuity in regulatory IDPs broadens their interaction repertoires and accelerates their evolution. By enabling reversible transitions between specialized network states, IDPs can ensure developmental continuity and evolutionary persistence, reconciling precision with evolvability in avian beak diversification.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2393

Bohan,"Abstract Understanding how biodiversity loss propagates through food web networks is essential for managing ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Traditional binary-topological approaches often oversimplify extinction dynamics by assuming that species go extinct only after complete resource loss. Here, we applied energetic thresholds to model secondary extinctions in 504 empirical food webs from the Farm Scale Evaluations of conventional and genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crop systems. We simulated species removals under varying consumer sensitivity to resource loss to assess food web robustness across crop types and management regimes. Results show that food web fragility increases with energetic thresholds, especially in GMHT-managed beet fields. Beet fields exhibit the highest levels of secondary extinction, and GMHT treatments show slightly higher extinction rates than conventional ones, suggesting increased vulnerability to species loss. Secondary extinction after single-species removals is higher in food webs lacking carnivorous links from carabids to gastropods. Keystone species shift from autotrophs to gastropods as the extinction threshold rises. Omnivory, particularly carabid–gastropod links, enhances stability by reducing secondary extinctions. These findings highlight the value of incorporating quantitative dynamics to better predict biodiversity loss and identify key species in agroecosystems, offering insights for designing more resilient agricultural systems.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1098/rspb.2025.2690

Nature-based solutions are increasingly promoted, but whether forests mitigate large floods remains a decades-long scientific controversy. Resolving this issue is crucial, as flood management necessitates reliable projections and a sound, scientifically defensible understanding. We show that the conventional deterministic approach uses a non-relevant research question, improper hypothesis, and non-causal experiment, rendering its conclusion that forests have little impact on large floods scientifically indefensible. In contrast, a causal, stochastic approach captures the probabilistic nature of floods and allows for studying anthropogenic effects to hydroclimatic variables through its relevant research questions, falsifiable hypotheses, controlled experiment, and sound physical reasoning. The defensible stochastic approach must replace flawed alternatives, suggesting that forests can mitigate large floods.

We address this gap by exploring the concept of land-system polarisation and identifying five key dimensions for its mapping: spatial scales, temporal scales, land-use sectors, indicators, and neighbourhood relationships. We propose and test a workflow using the EU’s crop production systems, showing that ~ 87% of NUTS2 regions display polarisation.

Geoghegan; Sasha Mader; Wenting Yu Burwell,"Abstract Reconnecting young people with nature is increasingly recognized as critical for human and planetary well‐being, yet opportunities for youth to form these connections are shrinking. Emotional affinity for nature (AFN) represents one pathway for strengthening these connections, supporting ongoing nature engagement and pro‐environmental attitudes and behaviours. Within this context, overnight summer camps may play a valuable role in fostering AFN in young people—especially those with limited access to nature in their home communities. Yet little is known about the conditions under which summer camps support the development of AFN. This study combined survey data from 323 youth attending 35 overnight camps across the United States ( M age = 9.6) with national spatial data on community green space. Using ordinary least squares regressions with standard errors clustered within camps, we (1) examined the role of emotionally meaningful experiences —operationalized as a combination of youth‐reported belonging and engagement—in predicting shifts in AFN, and (2) assessed the degree to which youths' everyday access to nature —operationalized as percent green space in youths' home communities—moderated this association, accounting for baseline AFN and demographic covariates. Results show that meaningful camp experiences positively predicted post‐camp AFN and that the relation between meaningful camp experiences and AFN did not depend on youths' everyday access to nature. Results were robust across various model specifications, including change score models, models excluding youth with high levels of pre‐camp AFN, and those that considered parent‐reported AFN in place of the youth‐reported measure. Findings suggest that overnight summer camps that offer youth a sense of belonging and engagement can cultivate their emotional connection to nature, even when they return to communities with limited green space after camp. As opportunities for outdoor engagement continue to decline in many communities, camps may offer a critical intervention point for fostering AFN and environmental stewardship in the next generation.

326,"Urban adults' engagement in nature education and its interplay with everyday lived experiences: A case study from Shenzhen, China",,,,,0.0,People and Nature,B,applied_ecology,Xiaoxue Chen; Zuyi Lyu; Junxi Qian,"Abstract Currently, scholarship on education to foster connectedness with nature primarily focuses on children. As adults likewise face the disconnection from nature and play a key role in influencing children, it is important to understand how they perceive, engage in, and benefit from relevant programmes. This epistemological angle advances a fuller assessment of such endeavours' contributions to wider public health and social well‐being. We conducted a case study based on in‐depth interviews with 14 adult volunteer nature instructors in Shenzhen, China, exploring their perceptions, practices, and experiences of nature education. Inductive, thematic analysis of the interviews reveals a dynamic interplay between urban adults' everyday experiences and their involvement in nature education, which is interpreted through a theoretical perspective of everyday urbanism and a relational approach towards nature in everyday life. This study uncovers (1) challenges of engaging urban adults in nature education due to hectic work routines and pragmatic preoccupation with making money; (2) an everyday pedagogy of nature education including principles of provisional learning of ecological knowledge, embodied experiences through multi‐sensory engagement, and routinized interactions with nearby nature; and (3) four dimensions of relational effects (nature, self, others, and the city) arising from everyday engagement in nature education, each contributing to volunteers' subjective well‐being and alleviating an entrenched sense of alienation in urban life. The findings (1) evidence how urban adults may benefit from nature‐based educational programmes in ways that differ from children; (2) highlight the significance of the everyday pedagogy of nature education that counteracts temporal and spatial constraints of urban living to benefit wider audiences; and (3) illuminate the embeddedness of nature education and broader sustainability‐oriented policies and initiatives in everyday urban life.

327,Mechanisms of species–people relationships in place attachment,,,,,0.0,People and Nature,B,applied_ecology,Edith Shum; Vanessa M. Adams; Georgina G. Gurney,"Abstract Species are recognised as integral components of the natural environment. Yet, research on species such as the role of plants and animals as important placemakers within people–place relationships remains limited. As environmental change continues to redefine our relationship to places, species can offer a new perspective into the underlying mechanisms of a changing place, thereby informing more effective strategies to better support individual connections with nature. Here we examined the role of species in placemaking by using a survey of 95 individuals to explore people's connection to fairy penguins ( Eudyptula minor ) and muttonbirds ( Ardenna tenuirostris ) at the Neck on Bruny Island. Building on the person–process–place framework, we tested the various pathways in which species can influence our connection to places and conducted a path analysis to understand the intersection between species, people and place attachment. Our best fitting model shows support for species having a significant indirect role in place attachment. In particular, our model highlights that species contribute to placemaking through process‐oriented bonds. Our findings also indicate that species are not just static features of places, but that bonds with species may transfer or enable a sense of continuity to other places with shared social and physical characteristics. By quantitatively assessing the role of species in placemaking, the pathways revealed can inform actions to support people's attachment to place, anticipate the potential implications of place change on people–place relationships, and shape framing strategies for encouraging participation in conservation and stewardship initiatives.

This paper fills a research gap by exploring the use patterns and accessibility of forests and parks across European cities, based on a standardised online survey of 10,462 people from 33 European countries. The results highlight a complex relationship between accessibility, socio‐demographic factors and personal motivations in shaping the use of forests and parks. Key findings include variations in visiting patterns by age and gender, with younger individuals and women showing a higher propensity for frequent visits. Motivations for forest and park use varied widely, ranging from physical health and recreation to social interaction and mental well‐being. Importantly, the study identified accessibility challenges, particularly travel time, connectivity and limited amenities (e.g. safe walking/cycling routes, lighting, toilets), which limit park and forest use. The results also highlight the diversity in use patterns across different European regions and based on gender, revealing significant variations in how people value and use forests and parks. The study suggests that socio‐demographic factors, accessibility and personal motivations play crucial roles in determining forest and park use, underscoring the importance of inclusive urban planning to accommodate diverse needs and preferences.

329,Wildland–urban interface expansion: Towards comprehensive planning processes,,,,,0.0,People and Nature,B,applied_ecology,Clara Mosso; Stephanie Kampf; Andrea Baudoin Farah,"Abstract Wildland–urban interface (WUI) expansion is accelerating in numerous regions around the world due to increasing amenity‐led migration processes, defined as the movement of people seeking higher environmental quality. While WUI areas are complex social–ecological systems requiring holistic planning and management, they are usually approached from wildfire risk mitigation perspectives that overlook broader people–nature relations. We explored the drivers of WUI expansion and the planning and management practices used to address WUI expansion‐related issues through two case studies: the Roaring Fork Valley (US) and San Martín de los Andes (Argentina). Through semi‐structured interviews, we assessed stakeholders' perceptions regarding current WUI planning and management practices and potential strategies for improvement, identifying opportunities to implement transdisciplinary landscape planning and management approaches in these systems. In particular, we highlighted WUI planning and management aspects that go beyond wildfire mitigation, addressing underlying causes of WUI expansion like amenity‐led migration. The drivers of WUI expansion in the study areas mirror those of amenity‐led migration, with a perceived higher life quality as compared to fully urban areas. The interaction of WUI areas with the tourism industry and the consequent rise in real estate prices increases the demand for housing solutions for both low‐ and high‐income sectors, putting pressure on WUI and wildland areas to serve as sites for new construction. This challenges the conception of amenity‐led migration as a process that solely affects wealthy sectors. In addition, different socioeconomic sectors may have varying vulnerability to WUI‐related risks. To improve WUI planning and management approaches, participants emphasized the need to integrate environmental and ecological considerations, such as changes in ecosystem services provision to identify potential sites for future housing development as well as housing density criteria. This latter idea proved contentious, with different stakeholders advocating for low‐density and high‐density developments, options that should be discussed through participatory processes. This study invites reflection on the benefits of transdisciplinarity (knowledge integration, bridging science and practice and enhancing stakeholder engagement) in the context of WUI social–ecological systems, providing insights into more comprehensive and collaborative approaches to WUI planning and management that consider people–nature relations.

Although communication is a core component in citizen science, the key factors that determine its effectiveness in national and transboundary campaigns aimed at broad audiences have remained unclear. Using the pan‐European citizen science campaign ‘Looking for Cowslips’ spanning across 31 European countries as an example, we explored the main communication facilitators and barriers campaign organisers face in different European regions when engaging the public in citizen science. To do so, we conducted interviews, questionnaires and discussion groups with the campaign organisers. The results indicate that communication in citizen science initiatives poses a challenge, particularly for researchers, who often do not have sufficient time or means for the necessary engagement and communication efforts. In addition to the ecological characteristics of the focal species in the different regions of Europe, the key aspects that need to be considered for planning effective communication in transboundary citizen science projects include various socio‐cultural factors, such as the traditions related to citizen science in different countries as well as local indigenous knowledge. Our study shows that collaboration between academic institutions and environmental non‐governmental organisations, but also the contribution by local co‐organisers at the national level, is crucial for the effectiveness of international citizen science campaigns. In addition, facilitators and barriers of communication need to be considered in each region separately as even at the European scale, we observed a high variability of environmental and socio‐cultural settings. Synthesis . In an era of detrimental consequences of human activities on natural ecosystems, it is vital to include society in observations to determine the impact of environmental change on biodiversity through citizen science approaches. Substantial advances in technological tools have helped to foster these initiatives across vast spatial scales. Nevertheless, it is also crucial to select the right pathways for communication to compete with vast amounts of other information and to reach potential participants in varying socio‐cultural contexts of different countries.

332,When honeybees come to town: Critical aspects of urban beekeeping and opportunities for regulation,,,,,0.0,People and Nature,B,applied_ecology,Joan Casanelles‐Abella; Katherine Baldock; Sara Diana Leonhardt; Marco Moretti; Mark Patterson; Monika Egerer,"Abstract Urban areas are increasingly valued for their role in conserving wild pollinators. Honeybees are often regarded as ambassador species for pollinator conservation, and beekeeping is frequently perceived as a pro‐biodiversity activity, which has become highly popular in urban areas. However, the rapid increase in documented urban honeybee populations raises concerns about potential competition for resources and disease spillover into wild bee populations. This calls for better regulation and management of urban beekeeping. Drawing on previous studies, we present and discuss six critical social‐ecological aspects of urban beekeeping, specifically, (1) the rapid growth of urban beekeeping, (2) asymmetries in the distribution of honeybee hives across beekeepers, (3) disrupted thermal balances, (4) knowledge and perceptions on urban floral resources, (5) competition for floral resources and (6) health management and disease transmission. We then discuss pathways towards a social‐ecological regulation of urban beekeeping. We advocate developing an urban bee management concept as a tool for establishing contextualized and equitable policies that work across urban land‐use gradients. Such a concept can support the management of urban landscapes for mixed uses, including biodiversity conservation and agricultural production, including beekeeping. However, this concept must emerge from co‐design and co‐creation processes involving all stakeholders, including beekeepers and conservationists, thereby integrating diverse views and preventing confrontation. In doing so, cities can better design, manage, and plan their landscapes to support all pollinators.

334,"Electrified rhythms: How hydropower infrastructure transforms hydrosocial relations of riverine communities in the Lower Sogamoso River, Colombia",,,,,0.0,People and Nature,B,applied_ecology,Laura Betancur‐Alarcón; Laura Pulgarín‐Morales; Camila Jiménez‐Saénz; Rossella Alba; Tobias Krueger,"Abstract Hydropower dams regulate water flows for millions of downstream inhabitants worldwide, altering water availability. Under a changing climate, flow control is often framed technically and politically as being essential for reducing drought and flood risks. However, it can also disrupt ecological flows, impact livelihoods and erode environmental knowledge. We contribute to this debate by examining how ribereños —rural communities in Colombia characterized by their interdependence with rivers—experience fluctuating water levels. We focus on ‘dry events’, situations where decreases in the river's water levels hinder ribereños' livelihoods. Our case study, the Lower Sogamoso River (dammed in 2014 by Hidrosogamoso Dam), no longer follows a clear pattern of rising and falling waters, which previously allowed ribereños to prepare socially and economically for seasonal activities. Drawing on a relational perspective on rivers and infrastructures, we mobilize the notion of rhythms to account for the temporal dimensions of hydrosocial relations and sociotechnical infrastructures. Using an interdisciplinary combination of ethnographic research and statistical analysis of hydrological and electricity data, three distinct situations come into view: the regular dry season, hourly low water levels and the 2015–2016 El Niño. Our findings demonstrate how temporal operations of hydropower and associated pricing mechanisms transform the hydrosocial relations of riverine communities. Daily operations disrupt gradual seasonal streamflow patterns, hindering seasonal livelihoods, while pricing decisions generate disruptive events on an hourly scale. During the 2015–2016 drought, the energy company's water storage and price bidding strategy led to unprecedented water level variations. Synthesis and applications . Our interdisciplinary approach made it possible to connect the temporal experiences of communities with large electricity market fluctuations. We emphasize that dry events must be assessed not only based on climatic conditions or dam presence but also taking into account the intersection of temporal logics at multiple scales. We underscore the need to evaluate streamflow variations at both daily and hourly scales, which are often overlooked in research and policy yet are essential for riverine cultures across the globe.

Kaltenborn; Emu Felicitas Ostermann‐Miyashita; Stefania Volani; John D. C. Linnell,"Abstract Conceptualising and organising the range of value orientations and worldviews underpinning human–nature relationships is useful for understanding different, and sometimes conflicting, perspectives on how nature should be managed and working towards just and equitable policies. We test the applicability and current scope of the Life Framework of Values ( living from‐, living in‐, living with‐ and living as‐nature ) by aligning it with pre‐existing literature, drawn heavily from the context of wildlife management and conservation, but with wider relevance. Pre‐existing value categorisations align with the Life Framework of Values in accounting for instrumental, relational and intrinsic values of nature. However, the framework does not account for the multiple ways in which people may be considered as living against‐, living separated from‐ and living disconnected from ‐/ living indifferently to‐nature. By first considering these additional worldviews, we then propose the introduction of a complimentary overarching living apart from nature value frame. We identify three pathways by which people may fall within the living apart from nature frame: (1) loving nature so deeply that you choose to separate yourself from it ( living separated from nature ), (2) disregarding nature to the extent that you are willing to destroy it ( living against nature ) and (3) becoming indifferent or disconnected, a state that can emerge from modern urban lifestyles ( living disconnected from‐/living indifferently to‐nature ). Synthesis and applications . Including the living apart from nature frame to the Life Framework of Values allows for a more realistic and complete view of the diversity of human–nature interactions thus helping it contribute to addressing the global biodiversity crisis and transforming societies towards more sustainable pathways. Future research should focus on empirically testing the extent to which people fit discretely and consistently into Life Frames or worldviews as opposed to simultaneously holding diverse positions on different specific issues.

Benavides,"Abstract Understanding the frequency and socio‐ecological drivers of contacts between humans and non‐human primates (NHPs) is crucial for enhancing coexistence that favours NHP conservation, while limiting negative consequences such as aggressions and cross‐species disease transmission. Increased human encroachment into NHP natural habitats and specific human behaviours have generated a diverse range of interactions at the human–NHP interface. In this systematic review, we summarized and characterized the existing literature on contacts at the human–NHP interface globally. Our analysis focused on research efforts related to disease transmission and the human dimensions of this socio‐ecological system. We included 821 scientific publications addressing contacts between humans and NHPs, which increased over time and covered most taxonomic groups (90% [75 out of 83] of extant NHP genera, and 51% [269 out of 528] of species). Research effort was unevenly distributed across the principal regions of NHP occurrence: Africa was the most cited continent (48% of publications), and Brazil the most studied country (10%), in contrast to a lower effort in Madagascar (2%), which ranks second in NHP richness. Our models showed that countries with higher NHP richness tend to have more publications, yet threatened, nocturnal and arboreal species were underrepresented. The most frequently studied taxa were the genus Macaca (18%) and the species Pan troglodytes (13%). Among 13 contact contexts examined, ‘hunting’ was the most reported (33%), followed by ‘habitat destruction’ (17%) and ‘tourism &amp; habituation’ (15%). Overall, 23% of publications included pathogen‐related contacts, with viruses being the most studied pathogen (51% of pathogen‐related papers), particularly in Africa. Only 29% of publications applied social sciences approaches to describe human–NHP contacts, with little change in their proportion over time. Our review highlights major disparities in research effort on human–NHP contacts across continents, countries and species, with pathogen‐related research biased towards viruses. The relatively low integration of social sciences underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate ecological and social dimensions to better understand and manage this complex socio‐ecological system.

Enhancing the recognition and scope of cultural ecosystem services in landscape,,,,,0.0,People and Nature,B,applied_ecology,Jan Daněk; Ľuboš Slovák; Tomáš Daněk; Jiří Pánek; Martin Schlossarek; Linda Blättler,"Abstract The cultural ecosystem services (CES) framework allows to systematically analyse non‐material human–nature relationships and can help to increase the recognition and scope of various intangible place‐based values. Although the amount of scientific literature addressing CES has increased over the last few decades, studies largely focus only on a limited portfolio of ‘prominent’ CES categories. The objective of this study was to explore a broad range of CES that people use in various landscapes. Reflecting the call to broaden conceptualisations of CES, we aimed to explore which CES contribute to place‐based emotions and eudaimonic values as well. We applied a combination of sociocultural valuation methods, including focus group discussions and intercept questionnaire surveys, in two protected landscape areas in the Czech Republic. The survey included various free‐listing exercises capturing CES in qualitative terms and a preference assessment using indicator statements. To identify a broad range of CES, we employed a combination of deductive and inductive approaches to CES classification. Visitors to the case study areas use and value a wide range of CES: free‐listing exercises identified 13–15 categories of them. In the context of reasons why people go to nature or visit their favourite places, Recreation, Ecophilia and Aesthetics were the CES most often mentioned. Our results also uncovered that many CES contribute to place‐based emotions and eudaimonic values, with CES Mental and physical health being the most prominent category. The exploratory nature of the research and the inclusive approach to CES classification facilitated the emergence of uncommon categories such as Ecophilia, which appeared among the most frequently mentioned CES. Our results confirm that using plural methods and within‐methods pluralizing approaches such as different question framings can enrich the CES diversity to be captured. We suggest that providing evidence about the use of CES can support better‐informed environmental management and landscape planning that seeks to balance the CES‐related multifunctionality of landscapes in protected areas, aligning conservation and landscape management more closely with the actual use and appreciation of CES.

Wood; Claire N. Spottiswoode,"Abstract Human language enables the exchange of complex information and precise instructions for collaborative planning and action. It rapidly evolves through social learning, generating diverse cultural communication signals used not only with other humans, but also with domesticated animals bred or trained to respond. More rarely, humans communicate with untrained, wild animals to coordinate joint actions, yet little is known about how or why these human‐to‐wildlife signals diversify. Human‐wildlife cooperation allows us to investigate whether human signals directed at untrained, wild animals exhibit regional variation, akin to dialects in human language. We investigated regional variation in human signals used to cooperate with greater honeyguides ( Indicator indicator ): wild birds that guide people to bees' nests in exchange for access to beeswax. Across 13 villages in northern Mozambique, we tested whether human honey‐hunting calls varied with spatial distance, as expected if regional dialects had emerged, or with measures of the physical environment affecting sound propagation, as expected if calls were shaped by habitat acoustics. Our analyses showed that trills, grunts, whoops, and whistles used while cooperating with honeyguides (i) consistently varied with spatial distance between villages, (ii) varied irrespective of the local habitat, and (iii) appeared to be adopted by immigrant honey‐hunters to match local calls. These findings suggest that regional variation in human‐to‐wildlife signals is shaped primarily by human social factors, forming a landscape of interspecific signal diversity similar to human language dialects. Honeyguides cooperate effectively with honey‐hunters throughout this landscape, suggesting that they accommodate (and likely reinforce) cultural differences by learning the local interspecies dialect.

It places a clear focus on ecosystems, with several goals and targets aimed at enhancing ecosystem area, integrity, connectivity, and resilience. Achieving these ambitions will require a robust understanding of ecosystem type, distribution and status, and mainstreaming of ecosystem data into reporting and decision‐making processes. Here, we assess Mozambique's terrestrial ecosystems using the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems framework and demonstrate how the results are being used to inform environmental decision‐making and GBF implementation. By assessing ecosystem loss, degradation, and the impacts of climate change, our findings show that more than half of Mozambique's ecosystems are threatened, with impacts primarily concentrated in temperate subhumid grasslands and pyric tussock savannas. Some ecosystem groups, such as tropical‐subtropical lowland rainforests, while less affected by range reduction, are threatened due to their naturally restricted distributions and ongoing degradation. Coverage of threatened ecosystems within protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas is substantially insufficient, highlighting clear priorities for expansion to achieve GBF targets. These results are now being used to influence national conservation policies and regulate private‐sector conservation efforts. This demonstrates how systematic Red List of Ecosystem assessments can inform robust environmental decision‐making and conservation planning, providing a valuable model for other countries aiming to implement the GBF and enhance ecosystem‐based conservation strategies.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/csp2.70189

A. Prowse; John Measey; Adam Toomes; Phillip Cassey,"Abstract Reptiles are popular exotic pets worldwide, with species valued for rarity, uniqueness, and colorful appearances. Despite Australia having banned the commercial export of native wildlife for several decades, Australian reptiles continually accumulate in international trade. For trade interventions to be most effective, approaches must be tailored to specific taxa or regions, based on comprehensive understandings of trade dynamics. We characterized the diversity of trade in endemic Australian squamates and used boosted regression trees (fitting separate models for snakes and lizards) to predict which species may be targeted for future trade. Contrary to expectations, species' color and patterning had little impact on trade presence. The main trait influencing presence was body size (length and mass), with larger species more likely to be traded. There was also a phylogenetic signal in trade; the larger‐bodied Pythonidae and Varanidae families were over‐represented, as were Australian geckos (Carphodactylidae and Diplodactylidae). From this novel understanding of trade, we predicted that 59 species possess traits that make them potential targets for future trade.

This 16‐year community science study, based on longitudinal data from the Taiwan Amphibians Database (2007–2023), assessed population trends among frogs. Our analysis revealed that relative habitat specialists experienced a greater proportion of population declines compared to relative habitat generalists, likely due to their narrower ecological niches and increased vulnerability to environmental changes. Furthermore, Polypedates braueri and Hyla chinensis showed greater declines than other native species, possibly due to ecological overlap with P. megacephalus , including niche similarity, predation, or pathogen transmission. At the community level, sites where P . megacephalus was present showed significantly higher proportions of declining native frog species in the univariate analysis, but this relationship was not significant after including environmental covariates, indicating a context‐dependent association rather than a direct causal effect. These findings underscore the importance of continued monitoring and management of P . megacephalus , particularly in low‐altitude and northern regions where the species is most prevalent.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/csp2.70244

Our study centers on hoverflies, the second most significant group of insect pollinators, following bees. The research was focused on Serbia, a country with a well‐established tradition of hoverfly research, offering ample data to support our objectives: presenting the Red List categories assigned to Serbian hoverfly species, determining the extent to which networks of Protected Areas (PAs) and Prime Hoverfly Areas (PHAs) encompass the distribution of threatened species and assessing the role of area size in their conservation. The results reveal distinct patterns between strictly protected and protected species: 43% of the strictly protected species were classified as Endangered (EN) on the European Red List, whereas 80% of the protected species were categorized as Least Concern. Overlapping the occurrence of threatened species with PHAs and PAs indicated several areas significant for preserving threatened species.

These developments promise to enhance conservation efforts, but they also raise ethical questions. While most existing research on conservation data justice focuses on large data sets and novel technologies, this paper explores data justice in community‐led conservation. We build on a conservation data justice framework, which distinguishes five dimensions of conservation data (composition, access, use, control, and consequences), by adding a sixth dimension: data collection. We apply this framework to two community‐led programs in Indonesian Borneo, supported by the Non‐Governmental Organization (NGO) Planet Indonesia. Through semi‐structured interviews with NGO staff and local community members, we examine how data justice is perceived and assessed in conservation practice.

355,The contribution of citizens to threatened plant conservation,,,,,0.0,Conservation Science and Practice,B,applied_ecology,Giuseppe Fenu; Giulia Calderisi; Donatella Cogoni,"Abstract There is growing recognition of the importance of citizens in biodiversity conservation, particularly in the Mediterranean Basin—a global biodiversity hotspot and cradle of several civilizations—where human actions have influenced the introduction, extinction, and relocation of plant species, determining their current distribution. This research aimed to understand the role of citizens in conserving flora of conservation interest in Sardinia. We used questionnaires administered to individual citizens to investigate whether their activities included intentional movements of endemic and threatened plants for conservation purposes (namely translocations). We documented 68 translocations; 69.5% of these were directly confirmed in the field, involving 22 plants, mainly woody and endemic to the island. Most of them were introductions and were successful, with 73.53% having live individuals surviving and 67.65% also having reproductive plants. Although our analysis covers a limited period of time and probably provides only a small snapshot of the total, these data reveal an important contribution of citizens to the practical conservation actions for threatened plants. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first attempt to quantify such contributions and suggests that the undocumented, spontaneous initiatives of citizens may far outnumber institutional efforts in both quantity and effectiveness. The contribution of citizens may represent a crucial component of regional biodiversity strategies if integrated and valued in more inclusive conservation strategies.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/csp2.70231

Schlesinger; Bryan N. Danforth,"Abstract Anthropogenic drivers of global change threaten bee diversity and the pollination services they provide. Despite the importance of bees, their conservation is complicated by limited and often heavily biased occurrence data. A recent state‐wide survey of insect pollinators across New York, United States generated a large spatial dataset of bee species occurrence records from community scientists, historical collections, and recent surveys. To predict the distributions of most of the state's bee species, we combined the state survey records with occurrence data from across the contiguous United States before applying an ensemble modeling approach consisting of balanced random forest and small bivariate generalized linear models. We predicted the spatial distribution of bee species richness using a stacked species distribution model with climate, land cover, and soil covariates. To inform bee diversity conservation, we predicted spatial variation for each species and groups of species sharing similar life history traits. We also estimated the statewide distribution of range‐size rarity, ecological uniqueness, and climate exposure. We found that the richness of modeled species is high across the state, with the greatest richness in regions with low soil clay content and intermediate forest cover. The fine spatial scale and extent of our gridded data layers match the scale of conservation action in the state, providing an opportunity to incorporate wild bee diversity into broader statewide conservation planning. Conserving bee pollinators is not straightforward, and decisions should be based on broader conservation priorities that incorporate bee biodiversity indicators into decision‐making. Here, we present a roadmap for the inclusion of these vital pollinators in conservation decisions by leveraging the best available data and methods robust to small sample sizes to provide spatially explicit data products representing the distribution of bee diversity.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/csp2.70239

Rehabilitation centers rescue, rear, and release manatees negatively impacted by human activities. Factors characterizing the survival of rescued manatees at these rehabilitation centers remain unclear. We analyzed data from 54 rescued manatees at a rehabilitation center in the Peruvian Amazon, assessing factors hypothesized to be predictors of the probability of survival during the rehabilitation process. We found that initial weight at intake and the rate of weight gain while at the center were significantly associated with a higher probability of survival. Intestinal obstruction, often linked to inappropriate diets prior to rescue, was the leading cause of death while in rehabilitation (13 of 54 individuals; 24%). Early intervention to transport orphaned calves to rescue centers and equipping local authorities with resources for short‐term care until transportation is possible could improve rescue outcomes.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/csp2.70235

D. Cobain; Jonna Kuha; Panu Oulasvirta; Katariina Rautiainen; Asta Vaso; Mikko Kiljunen,"Abstract Freshwater mussels are important in aquatic ecosystems but are among the most imperiled species globally. Freshwater pearl mussel (FPM) is a critically threatened species that probably relies on terrestrial organic matter (OM), which suggests that FPM is susceptible to disruptions in terrestrial–aquatic resource connectivity. We performed a regional‐scale field study covering 29 FPM populations across Finland to investigate whether terrestrial ecosystem modifications indirectly affect FPMs by disrupting OM inputs and impairing ecosystem connectivity. We also examined how the resource connectivity covaries along environmental gradients of water quality and catchment characteristics. We used Bayesian mixing models of hydrogen stable isotope ratios from terrestrial and aquatic OM sources to estimate the proportion of terrestrial inputs in FPM as a proxy for resource connectivity. We tested how environmental factors and terrestrial ecosystem alterations influenced connectivity and examined how connectivity and environmental conditions affected eight metrics of individual and population‐level condition in FPM. We found that FPM substantially relied on terrestrial OM across the region, implying strong connectivity. However, environments with higher anthropogenic pressures were associated with lower degrees of connectivity. Reduced connectivity and environmental change translated into lower relative growth and reduced muscle strength in FPM, implying poorer condition status in more human‐impacted areas. These results suggest that human‐induced environmental changes may alter the degree of resource connectivity, which in turn negatively impacts the condition of FPM. These findings highlight the importance of not only conserving ecosystems but also their connections with adjacent ecosystems to maintain the quality and quantity of energy flows which species may depend upon. Our findings also highlight the importance of catchment‐level conservation measures in preserving mussel habitats. Given the status of riverine mussels worldwide, our results are of importance not only to FPM but may inform conservation and management of threatened mussel species more broadly.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/csp2.70241

However, the observation of patterns is scale‐dependent, which poses a fundamental challenge for conservation policy under increasing anthropogenic pressure. This paper examines how choices on temporal and spatial modeling scales affect our understanding of species adaptation to changing environments, using tiger conservation in Nepal's Bardia National Park as a case study. Case study analysis revealed how tigers adapt to climate‐driven habitat modification through mechanisms invisible at coarse modeling scales. Different temporal scales uncovered distinct patterns of human‐wildlife coexistence, while spatial scales shaped our understanding of how habitat connectivity affects adaptation. This scale dependency of observation determines which processes we can discover and predict. We provide four novel recommendations for scale‐aware ecological modeling under global change: explicit documentation of scale contexts, probability models to compensate for abstraction, sensitivity analyses of scale choices, and connected models across scales.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/csp2.70193

Irrigation is especially critical in the seasonally dry tropics, enabling multiple cropping where otherwise only a single rainfed cycle would be feasible. Estimates of the current state of multiple cropping and the multiple cropping expansion potential without changes in irrigation patterns exist, but the multiple cropping expansion potential through irrigation expansion has not yet been assessed at the global scale. Here, we estimate multiple cropping expansion potentials on existing cropland considering the interaction with irrigation and local water availability constraints to determine how much cropland area can be managed in multiple cropping systems and the associated increases in annual yields and crop production. We find that, under current climatic conditions, there is considerable global biophysical potential to expand multiple cropping on existing cropland, particularly when also expanding irrigation. Total global crop production could increase by 28 % (from 4 200 mio. t DM to 5 400 mio. t DM). This gain stems from nearly quadrupling the area under rainfed multiple cropping, more than doubling multiple cropping area within already irrigated lands, and expanding irrigation into areas where it facilitates another growing season. Our study reveals a considerable multiple cropping expansion potential on existing cropland that – when tapped – could contribute to averting further cropland expansion to meet future demand for agricultural outputs. Local irrigation water availability constrains the irrigation-enabled multiple cropping potential, implying that the interaction of multiple cropping and irrigation is crucial to consider in comprehensive land and water assessments that account for biophysical and socio-economic constraints, sustainability criteria, and land competition under future global change.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae44ae

We conducted a long-term modeling study for the Rhine and Elbe basins and their 146 subbasins from 1950 to 2021 to quantify the roles of diffuse and, in particular, point sources in driving stream NO₃-N concentrations. In both basins, simulated results show a decline in point source contributions from 1950 to 2000, followed by a relatively stable level at around 25% in the Rhine and fluctuations around 30% levels in the Elbe. The decline in the simulated stream NO₃-N concentrations in both basins after 1990 was largely driven by a decrease in point sources, and stream NO₃-N concentrations remained high (~2 mg/L) during 2010–2021, even when point sources were excluded. At the subbasin level, changes in point source contributions and stream NO₃-N concentrations reflected the overall trends of their respective basins, although individual subbasins exhibited diverse patterns. In subbasins with high stream NO₃-N concentrations during 2010-2021, point source contribution accounted for around 30% (median values across subbasins), and the fractions of agricultural, urban, and industrial land cover were relatively high. These results highlight that point source management alone is not sufficient to reduce stream nitrate to a good ecological status (&lt; 2 mg/L), and spatial targeted management is required to achieve good ecological status at both the regional and local levels.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae44b0

This study identified distinct QDV in TCG during June–October, characterized by two leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes. The first mode (EOF1) exhibits a north-south dipole pattern and is indirectly modulated by solar variability through circulation anomalies over the mid-latitude North Pacific. The second mode (EOF2) exhibits a west-east dipole pattern and is driven by internal variability linked to the Pacific Quasi-decadal Oscillation (PQDO), represented by sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) in the tropical central Pacific (TCP). Both modes strongly correlate (r &gt; 0.83) with key regional indicators: regional mean 200-hPa geopotential height (150°E–180°, 34°N–44°N) and SSTa (164°E–164°W, 10°S–10°N). The direct influence of solar variability on TCG is weak, primarily due to offsetting effects of solar-associated in-phase SSTa between the mid-latitude North Pacific and the TCP. Solar variability and PQDO affect TCG primarily through dynamic factors, explaining about 85% of TCG changes, with relative vorticity contributing around 30%. These findings highlight the complex interplay between solar and internal forcings in modulating TCG, providing valuable insights for improving long-term TC forecasts.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae4411

However, such extreme events are mostly studied based on air temperature that does not fully capture thermal stress on Earth's surface layer. Here we explored the evolution of global heatwaves from near-surface air, land surface, to subsurface soils worldwide during 1980–2024. Results show heatwaves have strengthened across all layers, with a pronounced acceleration since the early 21st century. Relative to air and land surface, soils generally exhibit a greater heatwave exposure and severity. The peak intensity weakens as depth increases, with inter-layer differences closely linked to soil moisture, clay, and organic carbon content. The northern high latitudes are more prone to events of greater severity, particularly during summer, while lower latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere are characterized by events of greater persistence. Forests tend to buffer heat extremes, whereas non-forest land covers readily amplify heat exposure. Our findings imply that reliance on air temperature alone might underestimate heatwave risks to soil ecosystems, and soil temperature should be incorporated into monitoring and early-warning systems.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae4410

Musa,"Abstract Aquatic reactive nitrogen threatens human health and riverine and coastal ecosystems, yet its behavior under climate extremes remains poorly understood. Here we use a frequently cited SPARROW model to systematically assess the influence of climate extreme frequencies, defined by type intensity, duration, seasonality and co-occurrence of precipitation and temperature events, on the delivery of total nitrogen to river channels in the contiguous United States. Through multiple recalibrations of the model, we test the explanatory power of a wide range individual and combined mean and extreme climate predictors of total nitrogen flux at 425 US Geological Survey monitoring sites over a two-decade period. We use the Akaki information criterion for final optimized model selection. We find that hot/dry autumns, wet summers, and cool years enhance delivery, while dry summers and hot/wet autumns reduce delivery of total nitrogen. Using the final recalibrated model with temperature and precipitation inputs from three global circulation models, INM-CM4-8, GFDL-CM4, and CanESM5, under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 245 and 585, we compare the simulated impacts of changes in mean climate alone with changes in a combination of mean and extreme climate occurrence frequencies on total nitrogen flux from current levels to flux levels averaged over 2045-2054. We find that simulations accounting for the effects of extreme climate conditions differ significantly from those which consider only mean temperature and precipitation changes. Several regions, including some with significant agricultural activity, show a reversal in direction of simulated future total nitrogen flux, from reductions in flux due to a dominant effect of increased mean temperature to an increase in flux due to an overriding effect of more frequent extreme events.

However, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the costs of bio-jet including but not limited to costs of feedstock, transformation costs and the competition with co-products of bio-jet that may be demanded elsewhere in the transportation or energy sectors. Here we model alternative trajectories of biojet adoption in the US aviation industry by 2050 through the use of a global integrated multi sector dynamics model. We model three bio-jet production and consumption pathways, soybean oil to jet, corn ethanol to jet and Fisher-Tropsch-based bio-jet, with each pathway explicitly considering the co-production of renewable diesel and renewable gasoline alongside the bio-jet. We find that, without explicit actions or technology changes to offset the technology cost of biojet, scenarios where bio-jet displaces refined liquids result in higher aviation fuel prices (ranging from a 25% increase to 120% increase by mid century) and lower demand (ranging from -14% to -43%). We find that corn ethanol will play an important role in the US if large scale amounts of bio-jet are to be produced with smaller effects on demand and prices . While scenarios with high levels of bio-jet availability without the availability of ethanol to jet in the US can significantly reduce emissions in the aviation sector, these reductions are achieved more through the reduction in overall aviation fuel demand rather than technology adoption.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae440e

Understanding the drivers of N 2 O fluxes remains elusive, making it difficult to predict emissions in time and space and to develop and evaluate ways to lower emissions through management. Major scientific uncertainties underlying the understanding of the drivers of N 2 O fluxes identified in a workshop of N 2 O emissions experts include poor process-based understanding of controls on soil N 2 O emissions in the field; insufficient data to reduce uncertainty in N 2 O budgets from the field to regional scales, including N 2 O emission measurements and importantly, field-scale N balances; and, high uncertainty in model predictions of soil N 2 O emissions across environmental and management conditions.

Overall, reservoirs and their adjacent river reaches exhibit significantly greater variability (in standard deviation) than their natural counterparts across almost all SWOT observed (e.g., water surface elevation) and inferred (e.g., discharge) variables. Natural lakes show strong same-day correlations between inflow and outflow discharge (median Spearman R=0.8), whereas 76% of reservoirs exhibit maximum correlation when outflow is lagged, suggesting operations buffer seasonal flow variability.

Using remote sensing data, we present for the first time a comprehensive assessment of vegetation expansion across the ecologically fragile Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. During 2002–2023, vegetation expanded across nearly 1/5 of the barren land, with a change rate (–3.89 to –4.95 ×104 km2/10a) comparable in magnitude to regional glacier retreat and permafrost thaw. The upper limit shifted upslope (~35 m), while the lower limit shifted downslope (~150 m). This bidirectional expansion mode is associated with the alleviation of water limitation at lower elevations (due to wetting) and energy limitation at higher elevations (due to warming). Nevertheless, projection suggests this rapid downslope expansion may decelerate. The identified bidirectional pattern challenges the prevailing assumption of a uniform upslope shift in alpine vegetation under climate change.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae436d

Forest harvest fundamentally alters the physical structure and composition of forests, with consequences for climate regulation services. It can impact land surface temperature (LST) diurnally and seasonally, but the net LST impact of historical forest harvest activities in Europe is yet unknown. This study integrates satellite-derived data of LST and forest harvest for the period 2004-2023 to unravel spatial and temporal patterns of the surface temperature response to harvest disturbances in Europe. We find a consistent diurnal asymmetry: harvesting induces daytime warming alongside nighttime cooling across all seasons and forest types. However, the magnitude, net effect, and temporal evolution have strong heterogeneity. Regionally, daytime warming dominates in southern Europe (+0.075±0.007°C, mean ± standard error; +0.719°C at the 90th percentile), peaking in summer (+0.103±0.010°C; +0.823°C), while eastern Europe shows the strongest annual nighttime cooling (-0.060±0.005°C; -0.937°C). The response is weaker in Western Europe. Seasonally, net daily cooling prevails in spring, whereas net warming dominates in summer. Forest composition modulates the response: needleleaf forests show the strongest diurnal contrast, broadleaf forests exhibit the weakest daytime signal, and mixed forests display spring daytime cooling. After harvest, most regions transition from initial post-harvest warming towards longer-term cooling or neutrality after one or two decades, with the post-harvest pattern varying regionally and by forest types. Overall, this study elucidates strong spatiotemporal variation in net microclimate responses to forest harvesting across Europe, driven by geography, seasonality, and forest composition. By explicitly characterizing how forest harvesting alters surface temperature across space and time, these findings contribute to improved region-specific forest management strategies that can better balance timber production with climate regulation and biodiversity conservation under changing environmental conditions.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae424b

To quantify this R-P relation, we define the CRE parameter, which exhibits significant disparities across global climate models (GCMs), with most overestimating it relative to the observation. Given the strong correlation between the CRE parameter and both historical and future extreme precipitation, an emergent constraint on the hydrological cycle projection is constructed. It lowers the fractional increase in the 99.9th percentile of tropical precipitation by the end of the 21st century from 29% to 24% under the high-emission warming scenario, with a 58% reduction in uncertainty. Overall, GCMs tend to underestimate the intensity of tropical extreme precipitation while overestimating its fractional increase. These findings provide valuable insights for model evaluation, improvement, and climate adaptation strategies.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae4117

The impact of this trend on forest vegetation is still poorly understood, especially in areas not commonly subject to recurrent fires, i.e. in areas where tree species may not be adapted to fire and where flammability may increase as warming decreases moisture. Here we use recent advances in remote sensing to simulate burned area development until the end of the century under different climate scenarios. We then combine these projections with an European forest resources model to assess the impact of projected fire regimes on forests in three major biomes in Europe (i.e. Mediterranean, temperate and boreal forests, here represented by three countries: Spain, Germany and Sweden). Burned area was projected to increase in all regions in the 21st century, with the biggest increase and highest absolute damage in the Mediterranean region under the most severe climate scenario. Furthermore, we found that future fire disproportionately affects temperate forests, where a higher level of damage occurs for the same relative increase in burned area, compared to the other biomes. This was mostly due to the combination of increasingly favourable weather conditions for fire and large standing biomass, which drove the increased susceptibility of temperate regions to emerging wildfire regimes. Our findings call for mainstreaming fire and fuel management strategies into forest planning to increase resilience to fires, particularly in temperate regions with limited past fire occurrence and a projected increase in favourable fire weather.",,,0.75,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae4115

Accurately quantifying drought impacts is challenging and critical for mitigation. Here, we use a high-resolution, bottom-up assessment framework to analyze drought impacts on yields of four major crops—maize, soybean, rice, and wheat—at county, provincial, and national levels over 1997–2021. Results show yield losses escalate dramatically with spatial granularity, from 3.3% at the national level to 10.8% at the county level, with soybeans (16.3%) and maize (11.4%) being the most vulnerable. Despite an increase in drought frequency, drought-induced crop losses declined significantly, owing to the improvements in irrigation. Notably, a 10% increase in agricultural water use was significantly associated with a 1.71% reduction in yield losses. Our findings not only highlight the critical importance of scale-dependent risk assessments but also provide robust evidence and spatial pattern for the significant role of irrigation in mitigating drought risks.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae4114

Leveraging the recently homogenized daily Rs data at ~2,600 stations across China and Europe during 1961–2022, this study provided the first quantification of long-term variations in extremely low (Rs10p) and high (Rs90p) Rs and their contributions to Rs trends. During the dimming period, increasing Rs10p and decreasing Rs90p frequencies, along with increased magnitudes, jointly led to the dimming over China and Europe. Europe began to steadily brighten after 1980, due to early air pollution emission controls and reduced cloud cover, which reversed the frequency trends of Rs10p and Rs90p and intensified the severities of both extremes. In contrast, dimming in China persisted until 2014, only transitioning to brightening after the implementation of stricter emission controls which increased Rs90p frequencies but attenuated the severities of both extremes. Overall, Rs extremes jointly regulated Rs trends: China’s brightening was positively contributed by both extremes, while Europe's brightening was dominated by Rs90p but partially offset by Rs10p. These findings underscore the pivotal role of extremes in shaping overall Rs trends and highlight their importance for accurately assessing regional solar energy availability under global climate change.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae4112

Accurately partitioning net ecosystem exchange into its component fluxes – gross primary production (GPP) and respiration – is essential for understanding impacts of changing climate on the Arctic and boreal carbon balance, yet these component fluxes cannot be measured directly. Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) has been used to infer GPP at site to global scales, because its one-way uptake by plants is an analog for photosynthesis. However, expanding site-level process understanding to regional scales remains challenging. Here, we use atmospheric OCS mole fraction observations representative of Alaskan boreal forests to evaluate simulations of OCS fluxes in a state-of-the-science terrestrial biosphere model (TBM). We use TBM-estimated OCS fluxes and surface influence functions on the order of 100-1000 km to simulate OCS mole fractions at the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory’s CRV tower site in central Alaska. By comparing with atmospheric observations, we can evaluate the TBM over much larger scales than is possible using eddy covariance data while still providing valuable information about underlying mechanisms. Comparisons reveal a missing ecosystem sink corresponding to a concentration difference of 22.3 ± 9.1 ppt OCS for July-November relative to observed concentrations of 433 ± 26 ppt at CRV. Solely improving the temperature sensitivity of apparent mesophyll conductance reduces the July-November mismatch between modeled and observed OCS concentration data by ~5.3 ± 2.7 ppt. Consideration of alternate land cover maps provides an additional ~5.3  3.0 ppt towards the mismatch. These results demonstrate a strong decoupling of OCS and GPP, especially after the end of the growing season. Our analyses demonstrate the limitations of using OCS as a proxy for GPP and highlight potential missing processes that need to be incorporated into future OCS modeling efforts to maximize its potential as a photosynthetic tracer.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae4045

However, air pollutant concentrations reductions are not observable, and the related environmental benefits provided by the train service might be underestimated. Our research quantifies the emission reductions attributable to regional rail services by exploiting a natural experiment. We leverage an unexpected accident in Florence that temporarily disrupted part of the Tuscan railway network. We find that affected areas experienced, on average, a 25% increase in NO₂ pollution compared to counterfactual areas where train services remained operational. This increase was most pronounced during peak commuting hours. These findings are consistent with the assumption of substitutability between public and private transport: when regional trains were unavailable, more people had to switch to private vehicles to commute, causing a rise in local pollution. Our study provides an indirect measure of the positive environmental impact of public transport.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3fb2

While anticipating job losses is crucial for designing effective policy responses, we examine the future of coal workers across time and geographies in China and India under mitigation scenarios. We focus on mine workers who have been less studied, outnumber those in coal power plants, and are more geographically concentrated. Our approach enriches the results of an integrated assessment model by incorporating mine-level data and coupling with a novel module for demographic and labour mobility to understand how concentrated vulnerabilities challenge the transition. A decline in coal jobs is inevitable in China due to continued mining productivity increase. The potential employment reduces by 41% in the next decade even under current climate policies. On the other hand, India faces a critical crossroads as projected mining production growth surpasses productivity increases. Beyond national climate ambitions, differences in mining productivity, local economic diversification, labour concentration, and employment patterns drive subnational disparities in vulnerability to accelerated mitigation. Notably, Shanxi and Jharkhand, the main mining regions for each country, account for a third of the 1.2 million workers who may struggle to transition to other sectors in the next decade under ambitious emissions mitigation. Although they are less exposed with a smaller mining workforce, the challenges for unproductive regions such as West Bengal or Shandong are even more urgent. Our findings provide quantitative insights to guide just transition policies, emphasising the need for targeted support, including transitional assistance and economic diversification, in the most affected coal-producing regions.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3fb3

ROS events remain a highly challenging hydrometeorological problem in several aspects of land surface model development, pushing the limits of land-atmosphere, snowpack, and runoff modeling. In particular, the representation of turbulent fluxes during these events is critical as energy into the snowpack controls the rate of melt and may impact the magnitude of resulting flooding. In this study, we investigate the representation of these turbulent fluxes in the Weather Research &amp; Forecasting (WRF) model coupled to the Noah-MP land model during a ROS event. For this case study, we use an extreme ROS event which occurred on 12-13 March 2019 across Nebraska, Iowa, and Missouri, resulting in historic flooding and damages. Our WRF simulation of this event was compared with observations from AmeriFlux, snow products, and ERA5 reanalysis fields. While the simulation was able to produce the synoptic dynamics leading up to and during the event, there were notable discrepancies between the observed and modeled turbulent fluxes, suggesting that during ROS events, latent heat flux into the snowpack is underrepresented. Furthermore, analysis of the kilometer-scale WRF simulation run across the CONtiguous United States for 40 years at 4-km resolution (CONUS404) reveals the same underrepresented latent heat fluxes. Simple snowmelt and runoff models, forced with the observed fluxes as well as an experiment with reduced latent heat fluxes, shows that including the latent heat flux melts the snowpack quicker than without it, which has implications for the modeling of flooding in the region.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3fb0

However, uncertainties remain in how ET responds to tree cover (TC) change in Earth system models (ESMs), primarily due to the lack of large-scale observational constraints. Here, we synthesize flux tower measurements and satellite observations to quantify the sensitivity of ET to tropical TC change (∂ET/∂TC) under controlled climate conditions. Using both climate-bin regressions and space-time analogy approaches, we find a robust and significantly positive impact of TC on ET across multiple datasets and approaches, with an average sensitivity of ∼11.06 mm yr −1 per 1% change in TC. This sensitivity exhibits pronounced climate dependence, with ∂ET/∂TC amplified in arid and semi-arid regions, where additional TC enhances transpiration efficiency, but attenuated in humid regions as canopy–atmosphere decoupling limits energy exchange. These findings provide the first large-scale, observation-based quantification of ET sensitivity to TC change and establish an empirical benchmark for improving ESM representations of land–atmosphere feedbacks and predicting tropical forest resilience under the climate change.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3faf

Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) directly traces photosynthetic activity and offers a promising alternative, yet its mechanistic integration into yield models is still limited. In this study, given that the two different photosynthesis pathways C3 and C4 differ greatly in their environmental requirements, we apply this framework to estimate crop yield for two crops (C3: winter wheat and C4: summer maize) in the North China Plain. This framework is based on the mechanistic light reactions (MLRs) model utilizing remotely sensed SIF as a major input. The performance of the model was rigorously evaluated against official statistical yield records. Results indicate that from 2019 to 2022, both SIF and gross primary productivity (GPP) exhibited consistent and synchronous seasonal cycles, with clearly distinguishable dual-growing seasons corresponding to winter wheat and summer maize. Significant linear correlations between GPP and SIF were observed for both C3 and C4 crops, with stronger associations evident in C4 species. In addition, the strength of the SIF-yield relationship varied across phenological stages, and the cumulative SIF over the entire growth period (SIF total ) demonstrated the strongest correlation with yield. The MLR-SIF model achieved robust estimation accuracy for both crops (C3: R 2 = 0.6195, MAE = 0.6802 ton ha −1 , RMSE = 0.8301 ton ha −1 ; C4: R 2 = 0.6093, MAE = 0.6054 ton ha −1 , RMSE = 0.7483 ton ha −1 ).

Recharge in these regions is highly episodic and occurs mainly through ephemeral streams (i.e. focused recharge), yet the mechanisms that determine whether surface flows contribute to aquifer replenishment remain poorly constrained. A common assumption is that large floods dominate recharge, but evidence from long-term monitoring is limited and inconclusive. We combine a unique hydrogeological monitoring dataset from the arid zone (Fowlers Gap in western New South Wales, Australia) with numerical modelling of vadose zone processes to assess the controls on focused GW recharge. Our results show that even extreme floods that overtopped piezometers did not produce measurable recharge at the water table. In contrast, significant recharge occurred only during a temporal cluster of moderate flow events in 2022. Numerical simulations confirm that temporal flow clustering produces longer periods of ephemeral streamflow, which progressively wet the vadose zone, overcome evapotranspiration (ET)-driven moisture deficits, and increase relative hydraulic conductivity, enabling percolation to the water table. Isolated floods, by contrast, largely saturate only shallow sediments and water is subsequently lost to ET. By explicitly incorporating ET, our modelling provides a more realistic representation of dryland recharge dynamics and highlights the roles of antecedent conditions and vadose zone properties. These findings demonstrate that recharge is not governed by rainfall totals or intensity alone, but critically depends on the timing and sequence of storm events. The implications for climate change assessments and water management are substantial, as projected shifts toward more intense but less frequent rainfall may reduce opportunities for clustering and thereby limit GW replenishment. Process-based modelling and event-scale analyses are therefore essential for reliable recharge projections and sustainable GW management in drylands.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3e01

While such events are projected to intensify and become more frequent, gaps remain in understanding which agrometeorological hazards are most strongly associated with yield anomalies and crop failures. Here, we use data from 1981–2016 to assess statistical associations between different hazard indices and yields of five major cereals (maize, millet, sorghum, rice and wheat) across SSA, combining national, subnational and gridded datasets. Drought- and heat-related indicators emerge as the dominant correlates of negative yield anomalies, with vapour pressure deficit showing a consistent negative association across crops and scales. Yield anomalies in years classified as crop failures are more strongly linked to these hazards than overall interannual variability, indicating that severe yield losses are especially sensitive to agrometeorological extremes. Using interpretable machine-learning methods for maize and rice, two key staple cereals in SSA, we show that failure-year yield anomalies in maize are more strongly associated with drought-related indicators, whereas rice failures are more sensitive to temperature-related factors alongside drought metrics. Projections using combined Earth system and ensemble output of crop models reveal that under the high-emissions SSP585 scenario, both maize and rice-planting areas will face significant increases in heat and drought hazards by mid-century. Maize-growing regions are projected to experience a 1.8°C rise in maximum temperature and a 0.14 kPa increase in VPD, while rice-growing areas may see a 1.5°C rise in maximum temperature, a 15% increase in days above 35°C, and a 0.13 kPa rise in VPD. These projected changes underscore the need for targeted risk management, improved agronomic practices and robust early warning systems to enhance the resilience of SSA’s agricultural sector in a warming climate.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3dff

The conventional recharge/discharge theory effectively explains MLa Niñas preceded by strong El Niño events (SE-MLa Niñas), but fails to account for MLa Niñas occurring without preceding strong El Niño influences (NSE-MLa Niñas). Here we show, through integrated observational analyses and climate model simulations, that the Pacific meridional mode (PMM) acts as a key driver for the initiation and maintenance of NSE-MLa Niñas. Unlike SE-MLa Niñas, which rely on El Niño-induced oceanic memory, NSE-MLa Niñas are sustained by the PMM-related subtropical air–sea coupling processes, notably through an intensified wind–evaporation–sea surface temperature feedback mechanism as quantitatively diagnosed in this study. Future projections indicate that under global warming scenarios, the frequency of NSE-MLa Niñas may increase more relative to SE-MLa Niñas, possibly due to the enhanced PMM variability. These findings deepen our understanding of ENSO dynamics by uncovering subtropical processes as critical drivers of persistent La Niña conditions, with profound implications for advancing ENSO prediction systems.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3dfe

To move towards decarbonization goals while maintaining a just transition in the electricity sector, we assess the regional employment implications in 2035 of two policy ambitions, the ‘Fit for 55’ package of the European Union (EU) and a hypothetical EU-wide coal phaseout. We account for changes in employment and associated skills covering the whole supply chain from resource extraction to decommissioning, including electricity generation, storage, and transmission. Employment transfers are distinguished from employment gains to identify skill needs at a NUTS 2 regional scale. We find that net employment creation is higher and more evenly distributed under the ‘Fit for 55’ policy plan compared to the hypothetical EU coal phaseout. Under both policy scenarios, the skill requirements for the workers in transition (many of whom are transferring from fossil fuel technologies to low-carbon technologies) depend on the specific region, while the skill sets needed for employment gains are similar across all European regions as they are driven by employment growth in technologies that require similar skills (wind and solar power).

Although existing research has focused on objective and physical trade-offs, the politics around energy technologies like Alpine photovoltaics (PV), wind energy, and nuclear energy are not least shaped by how trade-offs are perceived by the people (first-order beliefs about trade-offs), including how respondents believe others in society view them (second-order beliefs about trade-offs). However, these remain insufficiently understood. Here, we conduct a population-representative survey experiment among 1,899 Swiss residents. We find that most participants perceive biodiversity conservation and landscape protection to be synergetic rather than a null-sum trade-off. Furthermore, most participants underestimate others' preferences for emission reductions over landscape protection. Rural residents --- who typically report lower trust in science and are more conservative --- are more likely to expect that others favour landscape protection over emission reductions, even though 62\% of Swiss residents prefer emission reductions. Strikingly, our survey experiment showing respondents information about the true societal preferences reveals that people are reluctant to revise their own preferences when seeing information about others' trade-off preferences (social influence) or their acceptance of energy projects, like Alpine PV, wind parks, sustaining nuclear stations, and new nuclear power plants. Non-experimental results show that people's own trade-off beliefs and perceptions of synergies with landscape protection and biodiversity conservation are more important to understand energy technology acceptance than second-order beliefs. This suggests that political debates may strategically emphasize trade-offs to advance particular agendas. Where renewable energy preferences are polarized, or political awareness is high, as in Switzerland, preferences may remain stable even when individuals learn that others hold different views.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3dfb

These represent translations of the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C to targets for central actors, such as countries, cities and companies. Net zero climate targets hold the potential of a paradigm shift in how individual actors pursue sustainability, away from incremental improvements and towards sufficient emission reductions. In this Topical Review, we argue that net zero targets should be complemented by absolute environmental sustainability assessment (AESA). This can inform decision-makers at different scales about the environmental performance required for societies to meet the needs of their citizens within the environment´s carrying capacities. We identify three limitations of current net zero climate targets: i) conflict with equity norms, ii) crude quantification of upstream and downstream emissions, and iii) risk causing burden shifts to other environmental problems. We use these three limitations to define four criteria that AESA methods should fulfill: 1) comprehensive in covering all relevant environmental problems, 2) consistent in the selection of environmental indicators and quantification of carrying capacities, 3) justice attentive in accommodating different stakeholder perspectives, and 4) granular in the representation of life cycle production technologies and their locations and timings. We find that existing AESA methods do not yet meet these four criteria and develop a research agenda for closing the gaps towards mature methods. We apply the research agenda on the case of science-based targets for nature (SBTN), demonstrating that it can guide future methodological innovation in AESA for improved decision support. The proposed research agenda may lead to advanced methods that reshape the practice of carrying out AESA and vastly increase its value in decision making at different scales.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3dfa

As previous studies have shown, we find that current new BEVs, with some exceptions for smaller or shorter-range vehicles, have a higher TCO than conventional alternatives. However, we also present the first comparative analysis of the TCO of used vehicles, which make up 70% of all vehicle purchases in the U.S. We find that for used vehicles, BEVs have the lowest TCO among all powertrains. As vehicle TCO varies spatially and with use patterns, we test 5 different vehicle classes, 17 different U.S. cities, and 5 different charging strategies. The finding that BEVs have the lowest total cost for used vehicles is robust across these variables and is largely driven by vehicle depreciation patterns. We conduct a regression analysis based on 260 000 publicly available used vehicle listings, collected from January to December of 2024. We find that BEVs depreciate more rapidly than other powertrains in the first several years of vehicle life but follow similar depreciation patterns afterwards. With a 7 year ownership period, buying a used (3 year-old) midsize SUV vs a new midsize SUV has a TCO savings of approximately $3000 for an ICEV, $1000 for an HEV or PHEV, and $13 000 for a BEV.

These wind farms function by harvesting a part of the wind energy that is itself the main driver of upper-ocean mixing and near-surface circulation. It remains unclear what the local and regional impacts of offshore wind farm deployment could be on marine environments. Here we consider potential effects from future wind farm developments in the Baltic Sea, in particular quantifying the impacts on energy exchange across the air-sea interface. We use plans for future wind farm coverage as a basis to calculate turbine-modified surface winds, and implement these altered wind fields as forcing for a three dimensional ocean (and sea ice) model of the entire Baltic Sea. We run ten years of simulations and examine the mean anomaly across the ten years relative to a corresponding set of model runs with unaltered winds, focusing on energy exchange terms and on the mixed layer depth. Based on an idealized mixed layer energy budget, we identify two routes by which the wake effect alters vertical mixing in the upper ocean - mechanical wind work and buoyancy forcing - and ultimately show substantial reductions to mixed layer depth in the close vicinity of wind turbines. Our model outputs show that, despite far-reaching instantaneous wind-wakes, the time-averaged changes in winds and in upper ocean response are mostly limited to areas within a 10 km radius of the nearest wind turbine. This result suggests that even moderate changes to wind farm placement may considerably alter the local impact on the marine environment, highlighting the important role of careful spatial planning in regulating wind farm deployment.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3cac

Conventional paradigms generally describe the relationship between MLD and stratification for the subsurface layer or the upper ocean below 5 m, where a weak stratification is associated with a deeper MLD, and a strong stratification with a shallower MLD. In this study, satellite-based and in situ-based monthly data from 2011 to 2021 reveal a positive relationship between monthly-averaged near-surface stratification (above the bulk layer) and MLD. That is, on a monthly timescale, a weaker near-surface stratification co-occurs with a shallower MLD, and vice versa. This observed pattern deviates from the conventional expectation. Analysis shows that this phase synchronization is primarily driven by density variations in the bulk layer, which exceed those in the subskin layer. Further investigation using wind stress and buoyancy flux data indicates that MLD deepening aligns with enhanced stratification above the bulk layer. These findings refine the traditional understanding by emphasizing the distinct roles of vertical layers (subskin vs. bulk). They underscore the necessity to incorporate layer-specific dynamics when using satellite-derived stratification to parameterize MLD dynamics in climate models. Such refinement is critical for optimizing predictions of ocean-atmosphere interactions and climate variability. Future work should leverage the fusion of satellite and in situ data to advance multi-layer ocean stability diagnostics.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3cab
416,Higher efficacy of SO <sub>2</sub> and accumulation mode-H <sub>2</sub> SO <sub>4</sub> stratospheric aerosol injection: insights from CESM2 and GEOS-Chem with Advanced Particle Microphysics (APM),,,,,0.0,Environmental Research Letters,A,applied_ecology,Fangqun Yu; Gan Luo; Arshad Arjunan Nair,"Abstract Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate the risks and damages of global warming. However, its radiative efficacydefined here as globally averaged radiative forcing per unit of sulfur injection rateremains highly uncertain in model simulations due to complex particle size evolution and large variability in aerosol representation. In this study, we employ a state-of-the-art, size-resolved (sectional) Advanced Particle Microphysics (APM) module within two global models (CESM2 and GEOS-Chem) to investigate the evolution and efficacy of stratospheric sulfate aerosols from both SO2 and accumulation mode sulfuric acid (AM-H2SO4) injection. Our comparison of SAI radiative efficacy based on various global models including the two APM-based (total 14 models for SO2 and 9 models for AM-H2SO4) shows a large spread, with lower and higher end values differing by a factor of ~2.5−3. Our APM-based results for SO2 SAI efficacy, including its diminishing returns with increasing sulfur injection rate (SIR), fall at the upper end of the inter-model spread. For AM-H2SO4 SAI, the APM-based models show significantly higher efficacy−by ~50% to 200−at lower SIR (≤ 5 Tg(S)·yr−1), followed by a steeper decrease in efficacy as SIR increases. Notably, the APM-based global model simulations show that AM-H2SO4 injections consistently exhibit higher efficacy than SO2 injections, yielding ~55–75% greater radiative forcing per Tg(S)·yr−1 due to more favorable particle size distributions. Global sulfate burden increase, effective particle sizes, and particle size distributions based on different models are compared and possible reasons leading to different SAI efficacy are discussed. The new SAI efficacy findings, if confirmed in further studies and model inter-comparisons, could have important implications for climate intervention strategies, cost-benefit analyses, and risk assessments.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3c38
418,Projected changes in sea level seasonal cycle alter global coastal flood hazards,,,,,0.0,Environmental Research Letters,A,applied_ecology,Ying Qu; Svetlana Jevrejeva; Jiayi Fang; Shijin Wang,"Abstract In coastal areas, projected increases in the amplitude of the sea level seasonal cycle will lead to the intensification of coastal flood hazards. Conversely, projected decreases in the amplitude may act to suppress flood hazards in some regions, partially offsetting the impact of sea level rise. Simulations of the sea level seasonal cycle by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models suggest changes up to ±30% are projected under a high emission scenario. We demonstrate that a currently unaccounted increase of 5–10 cm in the sea level seasonal cycle will increase the frequency of extremes from once in 20 years to once in 10 years. However, the sea level seasonal cycle amplitudes in CMIP6 models are underestimated compared to seasonal variability observed by satellite altimetry for almost all coastlines, suggesting that future changes might be underestimated, leading to a large impact on extreme sea levels in coastal areas. Including the changes in the future sea level seasonal cycle will advance future projections of sea level extremes and contribute to the crucial decisions about adaptation in coastal areas.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3b57
420,Modelling social norms in social-ecological systems: A systematic literature review,,,,,0.0,Environmental Research Letters,A,applied_ecology,Hannah Prawitz; Luana Schwarz; Jonathan F Donges,"Abstract Social norms play a pivotal role in sustainability transitions by shaping human behavior and influencing responses to challenges such as climate change and natural resource management. They can facilitate or impede collective action. Although simulation models help to explore norm dynamics, modeling approaches remain scattered and lack synthesis specific to social-ecological systems. This systematic review aims to map existing computational approaches to modeling social norms within social-ecological systems, identifying trends, gaps and implications for research and policy. We conducted a systematic search of Web of Science and Scopus (search date: November 15, 2024), screened abstracts using validated large language models, and selected 159 relevant studies for analysis. Key aspects analyzed included publication trends, thematic focus, modeling methods, spatial scale, behavioral theory incorporation and norm representation. Publications increased over 25 years, with most studies originating from Europe and North America. Two dominant themes emerged: common-pool resource management and individual consumption behavior. Agent-based and evolutionary game-theoretic models prevail, but many omit explicit behavioral theories beyond rational choice theory. Models are mostly local or regional in scale and theoretical in nature. Descriptive norms are generally modelled endogenously and injunctive norms exogenously. Interactions between norm types and dynamic norm signaling remain under-explored. To strengthen socio-ecological modeling and its policy relevance, future work should enhance geographic diversity, integrate behavioral theories more deeply and develop models that capture dynamically signalled norms in order to advance our understanding of human–environment interactions and sustainability transitions.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3b55

Sunshine Duration observations reveal the paradox of dimming event under strictest lockdown policies in February 2020 over Beijing. Modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis shows R s decreased abruptly by 12.89 W·m −2 in February 2020 compared to 2015–2019 (pre-pandemic), which is confirmed by Himiwari-8 satellite retrieved R s . Through multi-parameter attribution analysis, Shapley additive explanations indicated that an anomalous increase in aerosol optical depth contributed 31.700% to R s attenuation, primarily driven by chemical formation of secondary organic aerosols that offset benefits from reduced primary emissions. Simultaneously, modified cloud physical properties collectively accounted for 38.02% to R s attenuation. Specifically, doubled low cloud cover accounted for 23.89% while increased low cloud optical thickness contributed 13.52%. Further compounding these effects, weakened boundary layer dynamics exerted synergistic impacts: boundary layer height (BLH) compression (168.93 m) contributed 14.92% and reduced wind speed (0.63 m·s −1 ) contributed 9.51%, jointly promoting near-surface aerosol accumulation through suppressed pollutant diffusion. Additionally, elevated surface temperature (+1.36 °C) exacerbated R s attenuation by facilitating aerosol nucleation and cloud condensation nucleus formation. Collectively, these findings challenge the assumption that emission reduction invariably improves R s , ultimately confirming nonlinear climatic effects from coupled aerosol-cloud- R s interactions under abrupt anthropogenic disturbances.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3b54

Typhoon Hinnamnor (2022), which originated in the northwestern Pacific and weakened over the East Sea, demonstrates this interaction. While previous studies have explored typhoon intensification due to underlying MHWs, the formation of MHWs following a typhoon’s passage remains less understood. Post-typhoon MHWs can form due to local ocean heat uptake by anomalously cold sea surface temperatures overlying an anomalously warmer subsurface. This study provides the first detailed analysis of MHW formation on the west side of a typhoon path, off Korea’s east coast, approximately one week after the typhoon, using data from a fixed surface mooring. The results indicate that near-inertial internal gravity waves, influenced by sub-inertial background conditions, prevented the onset of the MHW during the week following the typhoon’s passage, despite favorable conditions such as coastal downwelling, increased surface net heat flux, and higher upper-ocean heat content.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3ab7

Using ERA5 reanalysis data, the interdecadal changes of Rossby wave energy propagation (RWEP) pathways and their impacts are examined in the present work. The results demonstrate that the NH means of 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies vary with large interdecadal trends that keep in step with global warming, exhibiting a negative-to-positive phase transition from period I (1950/51–1996/97) to period II (1997/98–2024/25). Pronounced interdecadal eastward shifts occur systematically in interannual variabilities of apparent wave sources, which correspondingly result in large interdecadal changes of RWEP pathways in regions from the northeast Atlantic to Eurasia and from the northeast Pacific to North America. Significant interannual surface air temperature anomalies with extremes of around ±5 °C are induced by circulation variations in regions around these pathways, facilitating possible occurrences of climate extremes in Eurasia and North America with different spatial patterns between period II and period I.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3ab6
426,Arctic warming delays the Afro-Asian monsoon retreat amplifying autumn rainfall,,,,,0.0,Environmental Research Letters,A,applied_ecology,Jie Zhang; Haishan Chen; Weiqiang Ma; Rafi Riaz; Sidra Syed; Irfan Ullah; Jiayu Shen,"Abstract The Afro-Asian summer monsoon (AfroA-SM) provides essential rainfall for billions of people. However, in recent decades, unusually wet conditions have persisted into autumn, creating unprecedented extremes. Using multidecadal observations, reanalysis datasets, and Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP) simulations, we show that Arctic warming significantly postpones the retreat of the AfroA-SM. This delay shifts the northernmost summer monsoon boundary by 5.6°–12° and accounts for 33%–69% of September precipitation across North Africa, South Asia, the Tibetan Plateau, and East Asia. The mechanism is anchored in a northward displacement of the subtropical jet stream, which is driven by reduced meridional temperature gradients resulting from sea‐ice loss and Arctic amplification. The resulting Eurasian anticyclone weakens the tropospheric dipole of the polar vortex, promoting negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)-like anomalies and a pronounced Eurasian wave train. These reinforce the northward shift of the subtropical high and enhance warm‐moisture advection into northernmost margin summer monsoon belts. PAMIP ensemble experiments further indicate that future Arctic amplification will intensify this autumn monsoon persistence and its associated precipitation. Our findings are critical for understanding the intensification of late-season hydroclimatic extremes, underscoring the urgent need for improved seasonal forecasting, adaptive agricultural strategies, and flood-risk management in a warming climate.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3974

Alongside orographic influences, urban areas can also act to intensify storms, but their impact on heavy rainfall in high elevations has not yet been investigated in detail. Here, we quantify the contribution of a high-altitude city to both rainfall intensification and its daytime and nighttime patterns, focusing on the city of Cuenca in the Ecuadorian Andes. Modeling several observed storms with and without the city suggests that the urban area can enhance downstream precipitation by over 20% over a pre-existing hotspot of orographically induced precipitation. This urban-induced rainfall intensification seems to exceed that observed for cities of comparable size outside mountainous regions. This may be explained by Cuenca’s valley setting and its high humidity compared to its surroundings, suggesting that high-altitude cities with similar morphologies could amplify combined orographic–dynamic and urban–thermodynamic effects.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae38f9

However, the sensitivity of scientific outcomes to dataset choice remains poorly understood, and evaluation using station-based records can favor datasets built heavily on weather stations. Here, we evaluate seven high-resolution daily gridded datasets covering the contiguous United States using independent meteorology from the FLUXNET2015 dataset, with a focus on the implications of dataset choice for process-based tree growth modeling. We find that gridded products tend to capture temperature accurately while consistently overestimating the magnitude and frequency of precipitation and its extremes. Moreover, datasets vary in how they define a ‘day,’ which significantly affects temporal alignment with FLUXNET2015 observations. Despite differences among the datasets, the interannual variability in tree ring simulations is insensitive to dataset choice, likely because daily-scale biases are averaged out through accumulated growth across several months. However, inaccuracies in temperature and precipitation can significantly bias modeled xylem cell production, with systematically higher annual precipitation in the gridded datasets leading to greater xylem production compared to simulations using in situ data. Our results suggest that model applications, especially those that integrate to time scales longer than one day, are likely insensitive to climate dataset choice, but applications that are sensitive to daily climate variations or to absolute climate values need to carefully consider biases in gridded climate products.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae384b

This review presents a systematic analysis of over 40 000 peer-reviewed articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science between 1980 and 2024, classified according to their disciplinary scope, marine environment, and climate-inspired framing (diagnosis, mitigation, adaptation). Our results reveal persistent structural imbalances: biology dominates thematically, beaches and coastlines dominate spatially, and diagnostic efforts far outnumber mitigation or adaptation studies. Crucially, the deep ocean—despite comprising the majority of marine volume and likely acting as a long-term reservoir for microplastics—remains severely underrepresented. Studies that include sampling below 1000 m are rare, and most lack specific geographic metadata. While the growth in microplastics literature is robust, its conceptual and spatial coverage remains narrow. We argue for a strategic expansion of research to include the full depth and breadth of the ocean, and for increased interdisciplinarity to reduce current uncertainties in global plastic budgets and support evidence-based mitigation efforts.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3849

We geolocate each power project and obtain forecasted physical climate risk exposures at these locations using data from Moody’s ESG Solutions. We measure transition climate risks using the project specific committed CO₂ emissions and find a positive correlation between physical and transition climate risks across these projects—which are driven primarily by fossil fuel investments. Coal power plants exhibit the highest level of both physical and transition climate risks. Although hydropower projects tend to have lower carbon emissions, they face the highest flood risk among all fuel types. We find no evidence that the positive relationship between physical and transition climate risks varies by financier country or financing type.

Under similar radiative forcing, particularly during daytime and clear-sky conditions, its temporal variability is expected to be coupled to surface conditions such as availability of soil moisture and plant functional conditions. In this study, we use Earth observations to identify regions with a strong interannual co-variability between the diurnal amplitude of land surface temperature and surface soil moisture. Land surface temperature is taken from the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Applications Facility on Land Surface Analysis and soil moisture from the Copernicus Climate Change Service for the period 2004–2023 over the 0° Meteosat Second Generation region, encompassing Africa and Europe. We introduce a new metric to quantify the soil moisture-temperature interannual co-variability in the satellite data, which is then applied to evaluate the fifth reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ERA5). Earth observations and ERA5 show similar spatial co-variability patterns across much of the domain, highlighting regions of transition between climate zones. However, ERA5 shows weaker co-variability in regions with large interannual vegetation variability. These findings suggest that accurately capturing the interannual variability of land surface temperature and its co-variability with soil moisture, in regions with large vegetation variability, may require a dynamic representation of vegetation status, beyond the mean annual cycles currently implemented in ERA5.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3789

Fires emit HCHO and its precursors and enhance secondary HCHO formation downwind, raising concerns about health impacts. However, the contribution of fire to ambient HCHO remains poorly quantified because ground-based monitoring is sparse and largely urban. Here, we present the first satellite-based quantification of fire-attributable HCHO enhancement and associated health risks across the contiguous U.S. from 2020–2023. We improve TROPOMI retrievals of HCHO columns to account for smoke aerosol effects, and evaluate the changes in column and surface HCHO under fire smoke using NOAA’s HMS smoke product. Annual mean HCHO shows a distinct increase under fire smoke, with vertical column density increased by 6%–16% and surface HCHO by 6%–11%. The spatial distribution of this enhancement aligns with major wildfire activities across California in 2020, the Pacific Northwest in 2021 and the Southern U.S. in 2022, and is most extensive in 2023, likely reflecting the combined influence of Canadian fire smoke intrusions, U.S. wildfires and elevated temperatures. Exposure at 2020–2023 levels translates to an estimated 275–482 excess lifetime cancer cases, indicating a non-negligible health burden from fire-related HCHO even in years of moderate fire activity.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3788

Despite widely available forest monitoring tools that effectively map deforestation, accurate and scalable remote sensing methods to detect selective logging are less advanced. Previous efforts are largely unable to reliably detect the low-intensity selective logging (&lt;10 m 3 ha −1 ) that dominates across much of the Amazon rainforest, the world’s largest remaining stock of tropical timber. Utilising a unique training dataset of high-resolution uninhabited aerial vehicle imagery from logged forests across the Peruvian Amazon, we build random forest models trained to detect selective logging using freely available optical satellite images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat. We find the Sentinel-2 model to be highly accurate (F1 score: 0.88, kappa: 0.85, false detection rate: 6.3%), outperforming the Landsat model (F1 score: 0.77, kappa: 0.74, false detection rate: 21.7%). Both models accurately detected 3- to 20-fold more selective logging activity in our validation data than widely available forest monitoring tools (TMF, GLAD-S2, RADD). We demonstrate novel uses for these logging-detection models in the monitoring of legal timber harvesting inside forest concessions and illegal harvesting of wood inside Protected Areas.

However, deforestation and increasingly frequent droughts, heatwaves and wildfires threaten these rainforests. Amazonian fires are generally assumed to be entirely anthropogenic, which has led to lightning-ignited fires being underexplored. Here, we present the first detailed assessment of the spatiotemporal patterns of lightning-ignited fires in the Amazon rainforest to elucidate the role of lightning and human ignitions in shaping Amazon fire dynamics. To do this, we matched cloud-to-ground lightning strokes from the Global Lightning Dataset (GLD360) with individual fire events between 2019 and 2024 to obtain a probability of lightning ignition for each fire. We also calculated a human-ignition probability index using proximity to roads, waterways, and human land cover as proxies for human activity. By combining both probabilistic indices with ground-observed lightning ignitions from eight protected areas, we could optimize the threshold that determines if an ignition is more likely to be caused by lightning or human activities. We estimate that in the Brazilian Amazon, lightning caused on average 0.2%–0.4% of all fires each year (234–407 ignitions per year) and 1.1%–1.2% of the annually burned area (1226–1358 km 2 per year) between 2019 and 2024. More than 89% of these fires occurred in the late dry season between August and November, peaking in September and October. Despite lightning-ignited fires contributing a small proportion of all Amazonian fires, they constitute over 25% of the fires in identified grid clusters in parts of the states of Pará (particularly in the Breves region), Amazonas, and Rondônia.

Using a nationwide dataset collected over five years (2018–2022), including crop types, management practices, soil properties, and environmental conditions, we estimate how the effects of winter wheat-based rotation vary across space and climate. Our results indicate that winter wheat generally enhances SOC levels, but its effectiveness is modulated by climate. Cooler regions experience higher SOC gains, whereas warmer regions show diminished or even negative effects. Future climate projections suggest that the potential for winter wheat carbon sequestration may decline under high-emission scenarios.

This descriptive scoping review pursues four objectives: (i) quantify CEC occurrence across the Global North and South, focusing on low- to middle-income developing countries (LMIDCs); (ii) assess policy frameworks and governance readiness; (iii) propose a feasible, phased roadmap for LMIDCs; and (iv) evaluate enabling conditions and potential impacts. Literature synthesised from 2020–2025 documents widespread contamination in drinking, surface, and wastewater, with concentrations in LMIDC hotspots 5–20 times higher than in the Global North. In South Africa’s Vaal River, PFAS exceeded 400 ng l −1 , pharmaceuticals approached 1000 ng l −1 , and MPs averaged approximately 31 particles m −3 in drinking water. Policy analysis reveals fragmented monitoring and limited treatment coverage in LMIDCs, in contrast to integrated, mixture-aware frameworks in the Global North. The proposed three-phase roadmap entails: (1) establishing CEC standards and baseline monitoring, (2) piloting targeted treatment supported by extended producer responsibility schemes, and (3) embedding adaptive, mixture-aware regulation within water safety plans. Feasibility analysis identifies enforceable standards, predictable financing, laboratory capacity, and public engagement as key success factors. Full implementation could reduce PFAS and pharmaceutical loads by 50%–80%, cut MPs by over 90%, and prevent multi-billion-dollar (USD) annual PFAS-related healthcare costs.

China, as both the world’s largest emitter and a region of rapid ecological change, plays a key role in the global carbon cycle. Yet uncertainties in atmospheric forcing datasets remain a significant source of uncertainty in land surface model simulations and are rarely assessed systematically. Here, we assess China’s terrestrial carbon budget (1979–2014) using the Community Land Model (CLM 5.0 ) driven by three widely used meteorological datasets: CRUNCEP, the Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3 (GSWP3), and the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD), and evaluated against more than 800 FLUXNET site-months and nine eddy covariance towers. Forcing choice strongly alters the magnitude and trend of carbon fluxes, and China’s terrestrial ecosystems acted as either a weak carbon sink or a net source, depending on the forcing. GSWP3 performed best overall in simulating gross primary productivity (GPP), CRUNCEP relatively poorly, and CMFD best in high-altitude and cold-dry regions. Total ecosystem carbon storage was estimated at 86.30–90.00 PgC, primarily in soil (84.1%) and vegetation (15.9%). Interannual GPP variability was mainly controlled by precipitation (29.4%), followed by temperature (17.2%), while shortwave radiation had negative effects (11.5%). Shapley additive explanations analysis further showed that moisture-related variables (precipitation and humidity) dominate interannual GPP variability. By combining process-based modeling and machine learning, this study shows how uncertainties in meteorological inputs affect terrestrial carbon dynamics. These findings underscore the limitations of single-forcing simulations in Earth system modeling and highlight the need for improved meteorological inputs to support robust carbon budgeting and climate neutrality goals.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae2af8

Despite its great potential, biochar production and scale use remain strikingly limited in Brazil. Here, we explored the multifaceted potential of biochar in Brazil, focusing on its capacity to promote circularity, create novel inputs for agricultural and environmental purposes, and optimize infrastructure for the production and cycling of organic residues from diverse agricultural and energy production chains. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders, and a workshop was organized with participants representing universities, public research institutes, private companies, and non-governmental organizations. We analyzed the current Brazilian scenario, identifying the main barriers preventing the widespread use of biochar in the country, as well as possible solutions in the economic, political, technological, R&amp;D, and innovation sectors. Based on this assessment, our results show that stakeholders view the Brazilian biochar sector as emerging but constrained by regulatory uncertainty, market fragmentation, and logistical bottlenecks. They identified five priority levers for change: the creation of clear and credible regulatory frameworks, region-specific strategies for biomass use and on-farm deployment, integration of biochar into robust carbon market mechanisms, strengthening of targeted research and demonstration projects, and development of business models that combine agricultural benefits, carbon removal, and co-products.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1088/1748-9326/ae36c4

Okere; Stephen Kelechi Dimnwobi; Ismail O. Fasanya; Ogoamaka Lilian Umeajaghaku,"Abstract This study investigates the quantile coherency between Load Capacity Factor (LCC) and its key drivers—technological innovation, FINTECH development, and natural resource rents—in four North African countries (Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia) over the period 1990 to 2022. The study employs quantile-frequency dynamics complemented by wavelet coherence as a robustness check to capture variations across the distribution. Findings reveal significant cross-country heterogeneity. Morocco experiences strong positive effects on upper-quantile LCC from technological innovation and FINTECH, whereas Algeria and Tunisia face pronounced lower-quantile LCC declines attributed to natural resource dependence. Egypt exhibits mixed outcomes, with upper-quantile benefits from high-tech offset by asymmetric risks across quantiles. Causal quantile results show asymmetric effects, where population and innovation reduce LCC mainly at lower and median quantiles, while resource rents become harmful at the upper quantile. FinTech improves LCC at the median quantile, and economic growth remains insignificant across all quantiles. Policy implications underscore the importance of tailored strategies that reflect these asymmetries: promoting renewable energy investments (e.g., Algeria’s solar potential and Morocco’s issuance of green bonds), enhancing FinTech inclusivity to reduce rural gaps (Tunisia), diversifying natural resource reliance through integrated water management (Egypt), and establishing asymmetric risk buffers such as sovereign funds to mitigate lower-quantile vulnerabilities. The findings highlight the necessity of incorporating time dynamics and socioeconomic distributional factors into environmental and energy policymaking for resource-dependent and digitally evolving North African economies.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1007/s10666-025-10093-3

Brehme; Robert N. Fisher; Aaron J. Bertoia; Darryl I. MacKenzie,"Abstract Predicting population abundance while accounting for uncertainty is an essential task for managers of endangered species but is often hindered by the challenge and expense of comprehensive data collection. Many traditional methods for estimating abundance of rare or elusive species are costly and logistically difficult, with occupancy‐based methods being a popular alternative. While the theoretical relationship between occupancy and abundance is well studied, there are few examples of methodological approaches for predicting abundance from occupancy. This study presents a novel approach to bridge the gap between abundance and occurrence for species with low capture probability, using the Pacific pocket mouse ( Perognathus longimembris pacificus ; PPM) in Southern California, USA, as a model system. PPM have been monitored across three subpopulations in this region using track tubes to inform occupancy over space and time and live captures to inform PPM demography and phenology. Paired capture–recapture data and presence–absence data collected between 2012 and 2022 were used to estimate density, occupancy, and detection, respectively. Density was modeled as a function of both occupancy and detection, and abundance at monthly and annual scales was predicted from estimates of density for all subpopulations. Our methodology leverages all available data in an integrated Bayesian analysis where uncertainty in site‐level abundance is naturally accounted for when scaling abundance estimates to the population level. While occupancy and detection were both predictive of and positively correlated with density, a meaningful amount of variation in density was not explained by our model, revealing avenues for future study as well as providing a realistic assessment of uncertainty in population‐level abundance predictions. In addition to advancing the current understanding of Pacific pocket mouse population dynamics, this approach is applicable to a wide array of species and ecosystems where population management is necessary, but individuals have low capture probability and available resources may preclude direct estimation of density at relevant spatial scales. From a design perspective, our results demonstrate the utility of strategically deploying density‐based monitoring methods within long‐term occupancy monitoring programs. More generally, our findings underscore the potential of this approach to inform methods to include abundance estimation in spatial occupancy monitoring programs for endangered species.",,,0.7,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/eap.70179

Felton; Laura Juvany; Per‐Ola Hedwall; Adam Felton; Julia Erbrech; Alina Sayn; Julien Morel; Märtha Wallgren; Anders Jarnemo; Leonie Schönbeck; Robert Spitzer,"Abstract Shrubs of the genus Vaccinium serve as foundation species in boreal ecosystems as they define much of the structure of the ground vegetation and play key roles in many ecosystem services and processes. For example, Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry) and Vaccinium vitis‐idaea (cowberry) constitute staple foods for several species of large herbivores (Cervidae, deer) in Northern Europe. However, changes to the tree layer from forestry practices have resulted in declines in habitat suitability and the abundance of these shrubs over recent decades. Here, we assess whether related changes to tree basal area and species composition also affect the macronutrient composition of these shrubs, and if so, how such alterations may influence food selection by moose ( Alces alces ). We sampled bilberry and cowberry twigs during wintertime in five study areas dispersed latitudinally in Sweden, using 65 forest stands dominated by Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) or Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) that varied in age and site fertility, while also taking into account soil C:N, pH, and moisture. We found that the macronutrient composition of bilberry and cowberry forage was significantly altered by forest density and tree species composition. In denser and more spruce‐dominated forests (i.e., lower understory light), forage contained less nonstructural carbohydrates, but more protein and lignin, compared to shrubs growing in more open and pine‐dominated forests. We also found that the forage available in such shaded environments was closer to the presumed nutritional target balance of moose. Our results illustrate that management decisions influence the macronutrient composition of understory shrubs in a way that may be important for herbivore foraging choices. We suggest that a larger variation in forest structure, both within and among stands across the landscape, will provide cervids with greater variation in forage qualities, since even small differences in forest structure can increase the nutritional variation of the forage. We discuss our results in the context of plant resource allocation, herbivore nutritional balancing and game and forest management.",,,0.6,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/eap.70182

Hansen; Kent Olsen; Signe Normand; Jens‐Christian Svenning,"Abstract Feral cattle ( Bos taurus ) and horses ( Equus ferus caballus ) are commonly introduced to European rewilding areas to halt vegetation succession and to conserve light‐demanding species. Yet, we still do not understand how the habitat preference of animals shapes vegetation structure at the landscape scale. Here, we used spatial preference modeling to understand drivers of space‐use based on GPS‐collared horses and cattle in a 120‐ha rewilding area in Denmark. Using a time series of a satellite‐based vegetation productivity index, we tested the ability of animal space‐use to explain changes in vegetation, as well as the trend of its spatial variability at the reserve scale, as a measure of landscape‐scale vegetation heterogeneity. We expected that animal space‐use would be driven mainly by topography and vegetation characteristics and that highly used areas with open vegetation would remain open. We, indeed, found that vegetation density and landscape connectivity were good predictors of space‐use preference for both cattle and horses. Additionally, both cattle and horses were strongly attracted to an artificial shelter located inside the reserve, warranting consideration of the use and placement of artificial infrastructure. Space‐use diverged during periods of resource scarcity emphasizing the value of introducing a variety of herbivore functional types for optimizing structural ecosystem heterogeneity. As expected, we found that cattle and horses slow down vegetation succession in highly used areas, as shown by the negative correlation between changes in growing season productivity and intensively used areas dominated by short herbaceous and shrubby vegetation. We could also show that the highly used areas showed the largest reductions and the fastest recovery in vegetation greenness following the pan‐European drought in 2018. A ~2/3 reduction in herbivore population size subsequent to the drought was followed by a general greening of the landscape, but with no clear relationship with space‐use intensity. Our study supports that trophic rewilding with year‐round grazing can limit vegetation densification at the landscape scale under near‐natural conditions. This is pertinent in the face of accelerating succession toward increasingly dark and tree‐dominated vegetation in temperate Europe's natural areas, and the associated biodiversity loss.",,,0.65,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/eap.70170

Comita,"Abstract Very low‐intensity selective logging can be a compromise between strict conservation and income‐generating land use in tropical forests. Investigating how selective logging influences the understory environment and seedling dynamics as the forest regenerates offers insights into whether logging alters forest dynamics, influencing the composition and structure of future forests. We explored how very low‐intensity logging (&lt;2 trees ha −1 ) influences understory factors and seedling dynamics across a logging chronosequence (unlogged forest vs. actively logged forest and forest logged 4 and 14 years prior). To do this, we assessed (1) how canopy openness, prevalence of vegetation damage, and elephant trails differ in logged forests at different recovery stages compared to unlogged forest; (2) how these understory factors influence seedling dynamics; (3) how seedling dynamics differ across the logging chronosequence; and (4) how logging impacts liana vs. tree seedlings across the chronosequence. We observed greater canopy openness and vegetation damage in logged forests up to 4 years after logging and higher elephant trail prevalence 14 years after logging compared to unlogged forests. Seedling survival was lower in plots with higher canopy openness, more vegetation damage, and on elephant trails, while growth and recruitment were not affected by these variables. Actively logged forests initially had lower seedling survival and recruitment, but higher growth rates compared to unlogged forests. However, 14 years after logging, seedling dynamics were mostly similar to unlogged forests. Liana seedlings had a slight growth advantage over tree seedlings in all logged forests compared to unlogged forests. Results from our study suggest that very low‐intensity selective logging causes temporary shifts in understory dynamics rather than long‐term shifts in forest recovery trajectories. These managed areas have potential as land that can contribute to OECM targets—functioning as mixed‐use corridors, connecting protected areas across a landscape and contributing to biodiversity and wildlife conservation—especially in countries with high forest cover and low deforestation.",,,0.7,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/eap.70180
759,Evaluating microclimatic alterations under rainout shelters: Intended and unintended effects of drought manipulations,,,,,0.0,Ecological Applications,A,applied_ecology,Shay Adar; Marcelo Sternberg,"Abstract Rainout shelters are research tools commonly used to simulate drought conditions in climate change experiments, allowing researchers to investigate the effects of reduced precipitation on ecosystem processes. However, these structures can introduce unintended microclimatic effects, such as changes in soil temperature and solar radiation, which can affect the interpretation of drought simulations. This study, conducted at a long‐term ecological research station in a Mediterranean shrubland ecosystem, assessed the intended and unintended microclimatic effects of different rainout shelter designs—striped and closed—on soil moisture, temperature, and solar radiation. Using sensors, we monitored microclimatic conditions beneath two rainout shelter design types simulating multiyear extreme drought with a 66% rainfall reduction. While both striped and closed rainout shelter types effectively reduced soil moisture, the magnitude of reduction was nonlinear and lower than expected (18%–40%). Additionally, rainout shelters increased soil temperatures in winter and decreased them in summer, likely due to wind‐blocking and shading. Solar radiation was reduced on average by ~20%, with maximum reductions of up to 40% under shelters. This study demonstrates how rainout shelters regulate soil moisture, but also unintentionally alter temperature and solar radiation, revealing seasonally contrasting thermal effects and nonlinear soil moisture reductions which may complicate the interpretation of drought manipulation experiments. This study also underscores the importance of tailoring experimental set‐ups to specific site conditions, such as soil texture and natural rainfall variability, to enhance experimental aims and ecological relevance. By addressing key methodological challenges, this study complements rainfall manipulation experiments and improves predictions of ecosystem responses to climate change.",,,0.65,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/eap.70172

Pitt; Lisa A. Venier; Greg W. Adams; Andrew W. McCartney,"Abstract Large old trees are widely recognized as ecologically important across forest landscapes and concern regarding the decline of these trees is well documented because of their role in maintaining biodiversity for a broad range of organisms. In response to a growing need to inventory such trees, we developed and present the methodology to map and quantify the occurrence of large trees based on height and dbh thresholds using airborne LiDAR data and associated canopy height models. The innovative, succinct, and flexible solution we offer is based on the integration and augmentation of several existing packages within the open‐source statistical software R. We use local tree‐height and crown diameter data to calibrate an algorithm to count individual trees above specified height thresholds, including supercanopy trees. To satisfy large‐tree definitions based on dbh, we used individual‐tree height and dbh data available from existing forest inventory plots to define height–dbh curves for dominant forest community types, which then allowed height thresholds to be used as a surrogate for specified dbh thresholds. We illustrate the use of these methods to efficiently map and quantify large tree distributions within 8 forest communities across a study area consisting of 1.65 million ha of productive, industrially managed forest in New Brunswick, Canada. Spatial maps are presented, along with large‐tree frequency statistics for specific communities, according to the definitions outlined in New Brunswick's provincial forest management guidelines. In excess of 37 million large trees are estimated to be broadly distributed across the study area. The methods developed identify patterns in the distribution of large trees across extensive areas (e.g., in millions of hectares) as one metric for maintenance of biodiversity at the landscape level.

While unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing enables micro‐patch detection, two methodological challenges persist: unclear response thresholds of landscape indices to spatial extent variations and diminished ecological interpretability due to redundancy in multidimensional indices. This study develops a novel scale‐adaptive framework integrating spatial extent effect analysis with principal component analysis‐driven (PCA‐driven) dimensionality reduction. Based on 34 landscape indices derived from UAV imagery (0.02‐m resolution), we systematically quantified sensitivity thresholds through spatial autocorrelation–heterogeneity trade‐off analysis across 2–50‐m spatial extents. The results showed that (1) Six critical indices, including number of patches (NP) and mean patch size (AREA_MN), exhibited significant sensitivity to spatial extent variations. The spatial extent effect curves identified 10–21‐m as the optimal domain, with 17‐m spatial extent optimally balancing spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity. (2) PCA reduced dimensionality to three factors (area‐based aggregation, spatial shape, and edge‐separation features), explaining 84% cumulative variance. Four indices—AREA_MN, mean patch euclidean nearest neighbor distance (ENN_MN), perimeter‐area fractal dimension (PAFRAC), and mean patch fractal dimension (FRAC_MN)—were identified as key characterization indices, establishing an early‐warning diagnostic system for degradation.

764,"Tree defenses, host choice, and reproductive success of a native bark beetle under novel outbreak conditions",,,,,0.0,Ecological Applications,A,applied_ecology,Grace Graham; Marcella Windmuller‐Campione; Daniel Griffin; Fraser McKee; Brian Aukema,"Abstract Bark beetles of the genus Dendroctonus are some of the most important disturbance agents in North American forests, having colonized conifers for millions of years. The selection pressure posed by tree‐killing bark beetles pushed trees to develop an arsenal of defensive strategies to which beetles have adapted in their turn. Recent surges in bark beetle‐related tree mortality have highlighted the potential of novel climatic and landscape conditions to push tightly calibrated relationships beyond historical norms. One such example is an unprecedented outbreak of the native eastern larch beetle (ELB), Dendroctonus simplex LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae; Scolytinae), that has killed eastern larch (tamarack), Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch, trees across more than 460,000 ha of forest in the Great Lakes Region since 2001. The ability of a bark beetle to attack healthy trees is dependent on sufficient local beetle numbers to overwhelm host defenses and a behavioral switch to target those trees that are avoided at lower population levels. ELB was not previously considered an aggressive tree colonizer, but extended growing seasons have contributed to recent eruptions in local populations of the species. We combined a dendrochronological analysis of tree cores with observational data collected from 2011 to 2013 in Beltrami Island State Forest, Minnesota, to understand tree defensive capacity and beetle outbreak dynamics in this understudied system. We found that preformed defenses visible in tamarack xylem were limited and did not determine host preference of ELB during our study. Beetles colonized the largest trees with the thickest phloem regardless of defensive capacity. Preformed resin defenses measured in tree phloem were correlated with reduced beetle reproductive success but were unrelated to resin metrics from tree xylem. With this work, the interaction between ELB and tamarack serves as a model to explore how climate change may alter species associations within native forest systems and the management challenges associated with underestimating historically benign pests.",,,0.5,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/eap.70176

Paruelo; William K. Lauenroth; Ingrid C. Burke,"Abstract Drylands make up approximately 40% of terrestrial ecosystems and hold up to 20% of the global soil organic carbon pool. Most semiarid drylands are, to some extent, grazed by livestock. However, the impact of livestock grazing on carbon cycle dynamics over large spatial and temporal scales remains uncertain, especially as the effects of climate change become more pronounced. Thus far, there has been little work, which has explored how site‐specific land management may interact with localized shifts in climate to affect biogeochemical processes in dryland ecosystems globally, particularly in the tropics. We used DAYCENT, an ecosystem simulation model, to explore how grazing intensity and projected climate change may impact biogeochemical dynamics in dryland sites in North America, South America, Asia, and Africa. Our simulation results showed a site‐specific biogeochemical response to livestock grazing and climate change, even across ecologically similar dryland systems. In sites that had smaller projected shifts in climate (i.e., the North and South American sites), heavy grazing decreased soil carbon inputs, outputs, and storage. In the other two sites, particularly in the African site, shifts in climate had the largest impact on simulated biogeochemical processes, with a projected 20% decrease in the soil organic carbon pool in the African site by the end of the century. Our study highlights the importance of considering how localized shifts in climate may affect dryland ecosystem function as this may overwhelm land management effects over longer time scales. Our work also suggests that more research is needed to better understand how small‐scale, site‐specific sensitivity to climate change and land use may influence dryland carbon cycle dynamics at the global scale, particularly in tropical regions.",,,0.5,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/eap.70175

To achieve this, we quantified the spatial distribution and co‐occurrence of hotspots (defined using the Getis‐Ord statistic) for euphausiids and nine of their commercially important fish and whale predators on the west coast of Canada during summer. We first developed fine‐scale spatiotemporal distribution models of euphausiids and Pacific hake using high‐resolution acoustic data from coast‐wide surveys conducted between 2007 and 2018. We found that the spatiotemporal distribution of hotspots of euphausiids and hake was variable between years with low direct overlap (apart from 2017). The summer of 2015, during the 2014–2016 marine heatwave event, was a particularly anomalous year, as euphausiids and hake showed spatial mismatch in their biomass hotspot distributions. For the other eight predator species, predictions from published species distribution models were used to identify spatial hotspots as an average across years. Co‐occurrence patterns were associated with the depth gradient across the shelf and slope and along the canyon and sea valley systems that characterize the Pacific coast of Canada. One assemblage was associated with the deeper parts (200–1000 m+) of the continental slope (euphausiids, hake, redbanded rockfish, sablefish, Pacific ocean perch, and humpback and fin whales) and a different assemblage (redstripe and yellowtail rockfish, and dogfish) was associated with the shallower shelf regions. Important ecological areas with co‐occurring multispecies hotspots occurred along the west coast of Vancouver Island, the sea valleys of Queen Charlotte Sound, and the northwest coast of Haida Gwaii.

Although streams and rivers (i.e., lotic ecosystems) can serve as conveyor belts of both aquatic and terrestrial eDNA from upstream or riparian areas, precipitation can dilute eDNA due to increasing discharge and/or mobilize eDNA into rivers from adjacent terrestrial ecosystems. Previous research has examined eDNA detectability of single species after high flow events, but no studies have compared aquatic and terrestrial communities recovered by eDNA metabarcoding together in response to rainfall. For this study, we used eDNA metabarcoding to sample three rivers before and after precipitation over six sampling events to evaluate if terrestrial eDNA exhibits a mobilization effect and aquatic eDNA exhibits a dilution effect after rainfall. We found that as rainfall increased, terrestrial taxa richness significantly increased and aquatic taxa richness decreased but not significantly. As such, researchers using eDNA metabarcoding from lotic ecosystems to characterize terrestrial communities might not need to avoid, and could even seek out, precipitation events in their sampling design. However, our study should be replicated over more lotic ecosystems and ecoregions and larger gradients of precipitation events.",,,0.6,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/eap.70169

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonise most terrestrial plants but are not expected to generate specific feedbacks due to low host specificity. We tested whether variation in mycorrhizal associations and associated rhizosphere metabolomes among co‐existing temperate grassland species leads to species‐specific plant–soil feedback. More mycorrhizal plant species showed more divergent plant–soil feedback: they experienced reduced growth and mycorrhizal colonisation in soils originating from weakly mycorrhizal species, but feedback became neutral in soil from species with similar mycorrhizal strategies. The species with the most self‐promoting soil feedback was characterised by strong metabolome shifts related to stress and immune responses following soil inoculum manipulation, while the metabolomes of species with more negative feedback were unresponsive. This study demonstrates that AM fungi can generate species‐specific plant–soil feedback, which can be predicted from plant mycorrhizal strategies and rhizosphere chemistry.",,,0.55,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/ele.70318

Once the world's most widely distributed mammal, its range has been drastically reduced by human‐driven habitat loss, persecution and competition for resources. Although listed as of Least Concern globally by the IUCN, the omission of climate change as a threat raises critical questions about its future persistence. This study examines dietary flexibility in European grey wolves ( Canis lupus ) using dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA). We compare British Pleistocene wolves from the Last Interglacial (MIS 5e) and the penultimate interglacial (MIS 7a–c) and contemporary wolves from Poland. Results suggest that during periods of elevated global temperatures, wolves exhibit evidence of increased durophagy.

We calculated functional redundancy, vulnerability and structural steadiness for fish communities across the Lancang–Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia and analysed their interrelationships using linear regressions, mixed‐effects models and piecewise structural equation modelling. Structural steadiness improved predictions of vulnerability beyond redundancy alone, and communities with unsteady structure exhibited high vulnerability despite high redundancy. Conservation efforts should seek to identify structurally unsteady communities and prioritise protection of functionally unique species, particularly in biodiversity‐rich regions.",,,0.5,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/ele.70336

We used historical land‐use maps in two Swedish landscapes across three centuries to examine the persistent influence of historical land use on plant and soil microbial communities. Overall, bacteria showed stronger legacy effects than fungi, but effects varied across functional groups of plant‐associated and free‐living taxa. However, soil‐borne plant pathogenic fungi showed a persisting influence of arable land use which gradually disappeared after ~150 years, suggesting that land‐use legacies decay over time. This dilution could relate to changing plant communities but also to changes in microbial associations, as suggested by species co‐occurrence patterns over time. Our findings provide novel and crucial information on the duration of land‐use legacies and single out soil‐borne plant pathogens as key indicator groups of historical land use in present‐day ecosystems.",,,0.5,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/ele.70332

However, the mechanisms underlying their spread remain poorly understood, largely due to limited and inconsistent data. Here, we integrate high‐resolution human mobility data with a thermo‐biologically realistic metapopulation model to investigate the colonisation dynamics of the dengue vector, Aedes albopictus , using 20 years of invasion data from Spain. Our results reveal the dual role of humans: as architects of climate change, making local environments increasingly suitable, and as vehicles of dispersal, inadvertently transporting this vector across regions. The spread occurs through a fragmented human mobility network, while natural dispersal bridges gaps between connected areas, enabling faster and more continuous expansion. These findings underscore the importance of considering the synergistic effects of climate, human movement, and natural dispersal when forecasting future range expansions and designing coordinated, multi‐scale vector control strategies in an era of rapid environmental change.",,,0.55,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/ele.70317

CFE theoretically increases with elevation due to the higher sensitivity of carboxylation to an increase of CO 2 under lower CO 2 partial pressure, but the elevation‐dependent CFE pattern has been largely overlooked. By conducting a 6‐year CO 2 enrichment experiment (+100 ppm) in an alpine grassland, we show that elevated CO 2 increased gross primary production (GPP) by 25.5% ± 4.6%. Water availability and plant biomass allocation modulates CFE during different seasons. A global synthesis of 10 CO 2 enrichment experiments reveals that CFE increased with elevation. The satellite‐based EC‐LUE model also demonstrates a positive global elevation‐dependent CFE pattern, albeit substantially weaker than that from experimental observations. Current terrestrial biosphere models, however, could not represent the elevation‐dependent pattern, highlighting the need to improve the representations of plants' elevational physiological adaptation to rising CO 2 in models.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/ele.70328

Chia; Anshuman Swain; Nathaniel Josephs; Lizhen Lin; William F. Fagan,"ABSTRACT Understanding why some viable body forms never evolve can reveal how ecological and evolutionary forces shape biodiversity. We investigate this question in the Passeroidea, a large group of songbirds, by analysing their morphological trait space using topological data analysis and ancestral state reconstruction. We identify a persistent morphological gap densely surrounded by extant species but unoccupied throughout passeroid diversification. The gap patterns deviate from stochastic expectations and show no evidence of past occupation, rendering undirected trait evolution and extinction unlikely. Similar morphologies exist in other bird lineages, ruling out intrinsic constraints or niche absence. Geographic distributions and traits of passeroids versus non‐passeroid gap occupants point to competitive exclusion as the plausible explanation: early‐colonising territorial specialists outside the Passeroidea may have preemptively occupied key habitats, limiting evolutionary opportunities for later‐arriving lineages. We demonstrate how historical contingency can shape macroevolutionary outcomes and introduce a generalizable framework for investigating structural gaps in trait evolution.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/ele.70320

Using wavelet analyses of a 19‐year coral community timeseries from Moorea, French Polynesia, we quantified timescale‐specific population synchrony in four common coral genera and evaluated the predictors of spatial portfolio effects. We detected synchrony within genera associated with synchrony in degree heating days, diurnal temperature range (DTR) and macroalgal cover at different timescales. Synchrony in DTR and macroalgal cover was associated with lower synchrony of Pocillopora and Porites populations , respectively. Population (for three of four genera) and environmental synchrony were stronger within than among habitats across timescales, underscoring the role of habitat‐specific conditions in driving spatial synchrony and spatial portfolios. These results describe how the spatial and temporal scales of heterogeneity in environmental and ecological conditions determine synchrony in coral population dynamics and support a spatial portfolio effect, which may buffer coral metapopulations from island‐scale collapse.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/ele.70324

Park; John Jackson; Anna Bergsten; Jon Ågren,"ABSTRACT Effects of climate change on phenological timing, like flowering onset, are crucial for population fitness and community dynamics. Recent research has focused on plastic responses to earlier springs, but the optimal phenological timing should depend also on the growing season duration, within which entire annual life cycles must unfold. Optimal energy allocation theory can address life‐history scheduling when this critical time window expands. Extending Iwasa and Cohen's (1989) framework, we predict a nonlinear relationship between growing season length and optimal flowering time of deciduous perennial plants measured from spring onset. Common‐garden experiments with purple loosestrife ( Lythrum salicaria ) and European goldenrod ( Solidago virgaurea ) along Swedish latitudinal gradients strongly supported this a priori prediction. As climate change alters both start and duration of growing seasons, our finding suggests that optimal flowering time expressed as calendar day could stall before accelerating its advancement in response to climate warming at current high‐latitude range margins.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/ele.70315

Disturbed populations often become tolerant towards humans, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We used playback experiments to manipulate perceived level of human disturbance in great tits ( Parus major ). In the first year, incubating females remained more often on the nest, and parents during brood care exhibited a lower level of vigilance and tended to have shorter return latencies in the human disturbance treatment than in control treatments, demonstrating an increased tolerance. These differences disappeared in the second year. Tolerance was also influenced by distance to roads and the frequency of nest visits by researchers.

Here, we develop a quantitative framework combining field data, epidemiological modelling, simulations, and Bayesian inference to pinpoint key viral hosts in multispecies bee communities. Using flower–visitor interaction data and molecular virus screening, we estimate species‐specific basic reproduction numbers ( R 0 ) and assess the role of both key hosts and community metrics in virus transmission and persistence. We show that, while honeybees often act as primary reservoirs for deformed wing virus and black queen cell virus, others, such as the bumblebee Bombus lapidarius , can drive the spread of acute bee paralysis virus.

However, how this tendency may destabilise forest ecosystems is poorly understood. Using a set of global tree‐ring data, we calculated the 5‐year variance and mean of tree growth rate over 1401–2010, and modelled the variance–mean relationship. We found that the global averaged variance increased much faster than the mean in the past century (+40.0% vs. +8.5%), and closely covaried with the accelerated global warming since the 1970s ( r = 0.93). The exponent of tree‐level variance–mean power law was higher in wetter habitats and less drought‐resistant species, and has increased significantly under global warming, indicating an environment‐ and trait‐dependent growth‐safety tradeoff and a decreasing resistance to a warmer climate.

Pardikes; Megan Higgie; Jan Hrček,"ABSTRACT A significant area of current research is the impact of warming on trophic networks. However, few interactions per network are typically studied, which limits generalisation and precludes evaluation of impact on consumer diet breadth and redundancy of top‐down control. Here we show that experimental warming strongly decreased the success of parasitoid development across 28 Drosophila‐ parasitoid interactions from a tropical rainforest network. Parasitoids responded consistently despite deep evolutionary divergence. Moreover, warming strongly narrowed the diversity of hosts that the parasitoids could use. Host developmental success was much less affected. In contrast, experimental cooling had only a mild effect on parasitoids and hosts. Our findings suggest that the top‐down control exerted by parasitoids is likely to weaken due to warming. The range of hosts that parasitoids can use will become more limited, potentially threatening the sustainability of parasitoid populations and changing the balance between trophic levels.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/ele.70322

In tropical semi‐arid savannas, while immediate drought effects are well‐studied, the drought legacy effects on vegetation composition and associated ecosystem functions remain unclear. We used data of vegetation composition, net ecosystem CO 2 exchange, surface albedo and evapotranspiration (ET) in 2017–2022 from a savanna ecosystem, Southwest China, to investigate the legacy effect of an extreme drought event that occurred in 2019. Vegetation declined continuously for 3 post‐drought years. While tree numbers declined by 12%, shrub numbers dropped by 50% compared with pre‐drought levels, shifting vegetation dominance toward trees. This structural change caused sustained reductions in albedo and ET, which remained below pre‐drought levels, despite gross primary production recovering in the years immediately post‐drought.

Here, we measured fine root exudation rates and chemical composition, functional traits, and soil microbial communities across 13 coexisting subtropical tree species. Root exudation release rates and composition tightly aligned with the conservative‐acquisitive root economics spectrum, bridging strategic synergy between roots and their microbial partners. Acquisitive roots with higher nitrogen concentrations released exudates at higher rates and greater chemodiversity, supporting more diverse microbial communities enriched in fast‐growing copiotrophs and saprotrophic fungi, but with reduced symbiotic fungal abundance, whereas conservative roots with higher tissue density showed the opposite pattern.

However, this has never been documented in the wild. In an exceptionally dense island population of Hermann's tortoises in Lake Prespa in North Macedonia, sexually coercive males dramatically overnumber females, inflict severe copulatory injuries and put them at risk of fatal falls from the island plateau's sheer rock faces. Harassed females are emaciated, reproduce less frequently, produce smaller clutches and have lower annual survival rates compared to females from a neighbouring mainland population. Sixteen years of capture‐recapture data reveal an ongoing extinction event and predict that the last island female will die in 2083. Paradoxically, while high population density might suggest prosperity, it can trigger population collapse under highly skewed adult sex ratio in a coercive mating system.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/ele.70296

Nordstrom; Ruth A. Hufbauer,"ABSTRACT Evolutionary rescue allows populations to adapt and persist despite severe environmental change. While well studied under density‐independent conditions, the role of density dependence, including competition, remains unclear. Theoretical models offer conflicting predictions, with density dependence either increasing extinction risk or enhancing adaptation. We empirically tested how density dependence influences evolutionary rescue by exposing experimental populations to a stressful environment for six generations under density‐dependent or independent conditions, with populations where either evolution was possible or was prevented by replacing individuals each generation. Density dependence suppressed population size and increased extinction risk, whereas density independence enabled rapid growth, especially in genetically diverse populations where evolution was possible. Although density dependence raises extinction risk, it does not prevent populations from responding to selection, since surviving density‐dependent populations still exhibited increased intrinsic and realised fitness. These findings reconcile theoretical discrepancies, showing density dependence can simultaneously increase extinction risk but may favour adaptation.

Williams; Peter B. Adler,"ABSTRACT Turnover in species composition often lags behind the pace of climate change, resulting in mismatches between climate and communities. However, the impact of these community‐climate disequilibria on ecosystem functions is rarely considered, and current methods for measuring disequilibria assume that species ranges were, until recently, in equilibrium with climate. Here, we develop a simple theoretical model to address both of these problems by linking community‐climate disequilibrium with ecosystem functioning. We show how disequilibrium can impair functioning in the near‐term even when climate change is expected to enhance functioning in the long‐term. Responses are most likely to change over time in communities where turnover is slow, the impact of disequilibrium counteracts the direct effects of climate on ecosystem function, and pre‐existing disequilibrium is large. These findings emphasise the importance of precise and unbiased estimates of community‐climate disequilibria for improving ecological forecasts. By fitting our model to time series of both climate and ecosystem function from a metacommunity simulation, we show the potential for community‐climate disequilibrium to be inferred without direct knowledge about species' distributions or climatic tolerances.

As MHWs intensified, changes in kelp abundances shifted from positive to negative. Warm‐edge populations displayed steeper declines in abundance change than central and cool‐edge populations under comparable MHWs. Our results support a hybrid thermal performance model, whereby thermal limits differ between populations, but performance volatility increases toward species' warm‐edge, heightening vulnerability of warm‐edge populations. Importantly, realised impacts of MHWs were evident at smaller thermal anomalies than predicted by experiments and distribution models, highlighting the importance of calibrating theoretical approaches with realised ecological change.

However, current theory on responses to such pulse perturbations focuses on equilibrium points and we lack a unified framework that accommodates other common, but more complicated, population fluctuations such as transients and cycles. Here we introduce this framework by deriving metrics that quantify the minimum, typical and maximum amplification of perturbed abundances for nonequilibrium population dynamics. By simulating models under several nonequilibrium scenarios, we demonstrate that these metrics accurately characterise the full range of amplification of perturbed abundances in the short and long terms. Notably, we show that perturbation amplification depends strongly on community state in the short term, but this state dependency vanishes in the long term.

Population variation in stress tolerance at the local scale was comparable to that across latitude. Consistent with local adaptation, populations from warmer and drier environments showed greater heat and desiccation tolerance and populations from more predictable environments showed greater plasticity. Climate adaptation at smaller geographic scales can therefore be comparable to adaptation across broad geographic scales.

Using standardised museum specimen photographs, we quantified colour variation via computer vision and tail shape with geometric morphometrics. We found significant evolutionary correlations between colour patterns and hindwing tail shapes across the phylogeny. Long tails were linked to high‐contrast stripes and marginal spots, while short tails were associated with simple, spotted patterns. While accounting for developmental constraints, we show that stripes, spots, and long tails evolved in correlation and likely form a visual syndrome promoted by natural selection to deflect predator attacks.

Our research bridges this gap, leveraging a uniquely high‐quality dataset spanning 8 years and 12 independent sites—offering unparalleled resolution to examine plant‐pollinator interactions. Here, we characterise year‐to‐year variation in plant‐pollinator interactions and compare their structural stability (a robust theoretical measure describing species persistence) with that of null models simulating random rewiring. We discover that although most interaction changes (80%) are caused by species turnover, it is the temporal rewiring among permanent species that primarily enhances pollinator persistence. This interaction rewiring is not random and effectively boosts pollinator persistence despite being primarily determined by changes in the phenologies and abundances of the permanent pollinator species.

We compared the long‐term incidence of harvesting, wildfires and drought‐driven forest dieback inside and outside Natura 2000 areas in Catalonia (NE Spain) by combining remote sensing‐derived maps of harvesting and wildfires (1985–2023), an exhaustive ground survey on forest dieback (2012–2023) and forest characteristics extracted from 3400 permanent plots inventoried in 1990, 2000 and 2015. From 1985 to 2023, remote sensing‐identified wildfires and harvesting affected 20% of the total forest area, with 60% attributed to harvesting and 40% to wildfires, highlighting the strong influence of wildfires on Mediterranean landscapes. From 2012 to 2023, the forest area affected by drought‐driven dieback (11%) matched the sum of the area of wildfires and harvesting for the same period or that of wildfires for 40 years, which suggests an increasing impact of drought‐driven dieback. Harvesting occurrence and intensity were significantly higher outside Natura 2000 sites, whereas protection did not influence wildfires or dieback, triggered by environmental and forest characteristics, that is, bioclimatic region, topography or leaf habit. Ultimately, a higher harvesting intensity did not prevent forests from experiencing drought‐driven dieback later. Synthesis and applications . Lower forest harvesting in Natura 2000 sites may align with socio‐economic barriers often claimed by local communities, but protection does not influence vulnerability to other disturbances. In a general scenario of reduced forest harvesting in the region, we argue that differences in harvesting due to protection are statistically significant but ecologically irrelevant in influencing wildfires or drought‐driven dieback. Moreover, beyond protection status, the lack of effects of the current harvesting intensities in halting drought‐driven dieback suggests they may be insufficient for supporting forests' adaptation to climate change. Additionally, other measures (e.g. promoting more drought‐tolerant tree species and genotypes) should also be considered.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70282

Cook; Merin Reji Chacko; Florian Altermatt; Marco Moretti,"Abstract Green roofs are increasingly acknowledged as novel habitats capable of sustaining diverse species assemblages. Due to their distinct abiotic conditions and stochastic colonization pathways, they are hypothesized to support ecological communities that differ from those of ground‐level habitats, yet the capacity of these habitats to sustain coherent and robust food webs is hardly known. Combining environmental DNA metabarcoding from soil samples with a metaweb approach, we compared the composition, structure and robustness of ground‐level and green roof food webs across 52 paired green roof and ground‐level sites along an urban densification gradient in Zurich, Switzerland. Food webs on green roofs were compositionally and structurally distinct from those at ground level. These networks were denser (higher connectance), more diffuse (greater omnivory) and less structured (increased trophic incoherence) than ground‐level webs. Together, this made the food webs on green roofs more prone to secondary extinctions. These patterns were largely driven by the predominance of predators and a lack of basal consumers, such as detritivores. Variation in food web properties was mediated by green roof design. Specifically, older roofs with deeper substrates supported sparsely connected, vertically diverse food webs that exhibited greater robustness to secondary extinctions than more recently built green roofs. Synthesis and applications . Green roofs operate as distinct habitats, offering novel environmental conditions, thus increasing urban habitat diversity and supporting denser but less robust food webs compared with ground‐level habitats. Increasing substrate depth and allowing for long‐term development can promote trophic diversity and robustness, informing strategies for urban biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70306

Houston; Themis Michailides; Juan Emilio Palomares‐Rius; James D. Bever; Eric S. Haag,"Abstract Agriculturally relevant crop species are universally associated with complex communities consisting of antagonists, commensals and mutualists. When the domesticated species are introduced into new habitats, some community associates can be left behind, and the consequences of such losses can be difficult to study. The cultivated fig Ficus carica and its community of mutualists and antagonists (wasps, nematodes and fungi) provide an excellent system to examine community shifts in this context. Cultivated F. carica can suffer significant losses due to a disease caused by Fusarium fungi. Through demographic surveys of F. carica figs in the USA and their wild European relatives as well as phylogenomic analysis of Fusarium species associated with fig and crop hosts, our research examines how species introductions can influence disease prevalence and severity. We found significant negative correlations between the presence of nematodes and fungi in wild F. carica figs in Europe. We observed similar negative correlations across wild Neotropical figs despite profound environmental differences. These observations suggest that nematodes are key components of fig communities and may directly mitigate or out‐compete pathogenic fungus. Following introduction from its endemic Mediterranean habitat to North America, F. carica crops lost an association with one endemic nematode. Consequently, we found F. carica figs in the USA to have significantly more fungal infestation than their European counterparts. Furthermore, transplantation through North America has introduced multiple novel fungal species into the F. carica system, which likely causes more severe disease for the US fig industry. Synthesis and applications : Similar negative effects associated with community disruption may be a common consequence of the introduction of many domesticated species. While it is difficult in many biological communities to successfully identify important associates and the effects of their potential losses during introduction, the biology of the fig community allows us to examine this context with greater clarity. We argue that fungal diseases in F. carica in the USA could be managed with the re‐introduction of nematodes. Further, nearly all crop species suffer losses due to a Fusarium pathogen, and nematodes may represent an unexpected and cost‐effective method of disease management beyond figs.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70292

However, their relative contribution and potential interactions remain unclear. Understanding these relationships is essential for conserving soil biodiversity, which underpins key ecosystem functions and services. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a field soil sampling campaign across 87 farms in the Netherlands to assess how field‐scale management and landscape structure in combination determine multiple soil communities, including bacteria, fungi, protists and invertebrates, in agroecosystems. Landscape structure significantly influenced the diversity and composition of soil organisms in addition to the strong influence of field‐scale management. In particular, the compositional landscape heterogeneity played a stronger role than configurational heterogeneity in shaping soil community composition. Importantly, the influence of landscape structure on soil diversity was independent of land use intensity at the field scale, with the exception of soil invertebrates. Synthesis and applications . These findings highlight the need for conservation strategies that integrate both field‐scale and landscape‐scale planning.

Petrzelkova,"Abstract Conservation success stories, such as the recovery of the isolated populations of mountain gorilla ( Gorilla beringei beringei ), are increasingly threatened by emerging health challenges. In the Virunga Massif, strongylid‐associated gastrointestinal disease has been linked to significant morbidity and mortality of mountain gorillas, posing a critical threat to this population's long‐term survival. Using metabarcoding of faecal samples (~65% of the population) and spatial and habitat analyses, we examined the composition and drivers of strongylid nematode communities and their role in clinical disease emergence. We identified Hyostrongylus nematodes, known pathogens in suids, as the primary contributors to gastric lesions observed in necropsied gorillas. Spatial variation in strongylid communities is correlated with environmental gradients, indicating that environmental factors such as climate and vegetation play a significant role in shaping strongylid community composition. Additionally, limited genetic diversity resulting from historical population bottlenecks may negatively impact the health of gorillas affected by parasites. Our findings suggest that the high absolute abundance of pathogenic Hyostrongylus is concentrated in specific high‐altitude regions, aligning with observed cases of severe gastritis. Synthesis and applications . These findings highlight an emerging health threat for mountain gorillas, with implications for other isolated wildlife populations facing similar ecological and evolutionary pressures. The study calls for continued monitoring of parasitic diseases in wildlife populations, especially those in fragmented habitats with limited capacity for expansion, to mitigate potential risks to their conservation.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70258
807,Intercropping and cover cropping differentially alter maize secondary metabolism and affect herbivore resistance,,,,,0.0,Journal of Applied Ecology,A,applied_ecology,Juan Pablo Jordán; André Kessler,"Abstract Diversified agricultural systems such as intercropping and cover cropping provide a wide range of emergent properties that can positively impact agricultural performance metrics. Both cropping systems by leveraging distinct ecological processes such as associational resistance and plant–soil feedbacks can facilitate soil health while increasing pest resistance and crop productivity. However, the extent to which the cropping system in general and the companion plant species in particular induce changes to plant metabolism as a mechanism mediating plant resistance remains understudied and limits a wider application of companion cropping technologies. To close this gap, we use microcosm experiments that simulate intercropping and cover cropping practices by manipulating plant neighbourhood and soil conditioning to investigate how three different companion legume species change plant secondary metabolite profiles and the resulting effects on herbivore resistance of maize plants. By utilizing a conventional maize variety (genetically modified; bt‐transformed), we further test the potential for such ecosystem services to persist under industrialized agricultural systems. The non‐volatile secondary metabolite profiles of maize leaves and roots differed across intercropping and cover cropping systems, while volatile organic compound emissions remained largely unchanged. Defence‐related compounds such as benzoxazinoids were generally upregulated under intercropping, while the companion plant identity further shaped the maize defence profile with bean intercropping specifically upregulating benzoxazinoid compounds. Resistance bioassays with the generalist herbivore Spodoptera frugiperda revealed that intercropping significantly reduces leaf damage relative to cover cropping. Among the intercrops, beans increase larval mortality while alfalfa decreases larval mortality on maize plants. Synthesis and applications . We demonstrate that intercropping and cover cropping can shape the overall secondary metabolite profiles of maize and mediate herbivore resistance. These findings underscore that crop diversification strategies can specifically modulate the expression of chemical defences linked to herbivore resistance. In practical terms, this means that diversified cropping systems can be optimized to enhance constitutive levels of pest resistance, potentially reducing the reliance on insecticides, increasing sustainability and supporting yield. The fact that positive resistance effects persist even when using pest‐resistant GM crops suggests companion cropping practices as a valid tool to increase the sustainable management of insect pests.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70284
808,Pruning for biodiversity: Drivers of cavity formation and use in Mediterranean holm oak woodlands,,,,,0.0,Journal of Applied Ecology,A,applied_ecology,Iván de la Hera; Jesús M. Avilés,"Abstract A critical aspect of effective forest policies is the promotion of tree‐related microhabitats, such as tree cavities, which serve as keystone structures for biodiversity. However, our understanding of the factors driving cavity formation and their use by vertebrates remains limited, particularly in holm oak Quercus ilex woodlands, which cover large areas of the Mediterranean region. We examined 22 holm oak stands that varied widely in experienced pruning intensity and tree age within two national parks in central Spain. We also recorded likely cavity origin, position (whether on a branch or on the trunk), volume and use by vertebrates. We found that pruning is the primary trigger of cavity initiation. However, cavity development from pruning wounds was uncommon, and the transition to a cavity suitable for a vertebrate occurred slowly. The relationship between pruning intensity and cavity occurrence was steeper in small trees than in large ones. In addition, trunk width was more strongly related to cavity volume in trunk cavities than in branch cavities, leading to a wider range of cavity sizes in large trees. Vertebrate occupancy was low, and cavity volume was the primary predictor of cavity use. Synthesis and applications . Our study emphasizes the role of both tree and cavity age in the long‐term establishment of cavity‐dependent vertebrates in holm oak woodlands. In the context of climate change—where holm oak trees are expected to replace more mesic, soft‐wooded tree species in the Mediterranean region—the persistence of cavity‐dependent vertebrate biodiversity will rely on the formation of cavities through appropriate pruning management, which creates the structural conditions necessary for cavity development.",,,0.75,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70291

Maruyama,"Abstract Understanding how species interactions, such as those between plants and their pollinators, are structured in human‐transformed habitats is a key challenge in modern ecology. However, the relative importance of the drivers structuring interactions may vary depending on the ecological and environmental context. We investigated the influence of three ecological drivers of plant–pollinator interactions in urban landscapes of a tropical metropolis: spatiotemporal overlap (species phenology within and across sites), interaction neutrality (species abundance) and trait matching (compatibility in morphological traits). We collected floral interaction data from different pollinator groups, including bees, butterflies, flies and wasps in distinct urban landscapes. We found that spatiotemporal overlap and neutrality were the primary drivers of interactions, while trait matching had minimal effect, likely reflecting the predominance of generalist species in urban environments and reducing morphological constraints on species interactions. The observed negative correlation between neutrality and trait matching indicates that as the importance of species abundances increases, the influence of trait matching decreases. When examined by pollinator groups, spatiotemporal overlap also emerged as the most important driver for bees and butterflies. However, we detected a seasonal variation where spatiotemporal overlap was relatively more important during the rainy season, while neutrality played a greater role in the dry season. This contrast may arise owed to differences in floral resource availability, which are scarcer during the dry season and when some mass flowering plants attract many of the available pollinators. Synthesis and applications . Our study shows that the generalized structure of urban plant–pollinator interactions is mirrored in the mechanisms that shape them, as interactions are governed primarily by less restrictive drivers such as abundance and spatiotemporal overlap rather than by trait matching. To enhance the diversity of interactions, urban landscapes with a high diversity of plant species that bloom year‐round and are attractive to different pollinator groups are needed. By doing so, tropical cities can ensure pollinators across seasons and foster interactions of different pollinator groups.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70287

Among the driving factors are nitrogen deposition and climate change, which typically increase vegetation productivity and extend the growing season. These changes can negatively affect plant diversity and simplify vegetation structure and thereby indirectly reduce arthropod diversity. Adjusting the mowing frequency, height and/or timing may counteract these effects and address shifts in seasonal activity of arthropods. This study evaluated the effects of these adjustments on arthropod diversity under current environmental conditions. We performed a 3‐year (2021–2023) field experiment in 10 Dutch roadside grasslands across a productivity gradient. The standard late August mowing (control) was compared to early November mowing and to June mowing at high (15 cm) or low (6 cm) height followed by either late August or early November mowing. In 2023, we assessed the effects of these mowing treatments on ground‐dwelling arthropods (sampled using pitfall traps), emerging arthropods (soil‐ and vegetation‐dwelling arthropods sampled using emergence traps) and flower availability (used as a proxy for food availability for pollinators). Our results show that delaying the final cut to early November was advantageous for late‐season emerging arthropods and flower availability regardless of site productivity. Emerging arthropod biomass in early autumn was approximately equal to that in spring and summer, underscoring the importance of delaying the final cut. In low‐productive sites, increasing the mowing frequency from one to two cuts per year did not benefit any species group. Conversely, in high‐productive sites, increasing the mowing frequency generally increased the diversity of ground‐dwelling arthropods, particularly in summer, and increased flower availability in spring. These benefits were most pronounced with a low cut in June. Yet, the June cut caused a relatively long (&gt;1 month) reduction in flower availability and a lower summer biomass of emerging arthropods, regardless of cutting height. This suggests that regimes with two cuts per year could be more beneficial if applied in a phased or rotational manner. Synthesis and applications . Adjusted mowing dates and, in productive grasslands, an increased mowing frequency may benefit grassland arthropod communities under current environmental conditions.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70289

Moreover, increasing host‐crop areas can directly affect the dynamics of pest or pathogen populations by providing them with more resources. However, the actual beneficial impacts of diversifying agricultural landscapes on pest or pathogen population levels are still poorly demonstrated, limiting farmers' adoption of such approaches. Here, using national‐scale data collected between 2014 and 2019 and Bayesian spatial models, we investigated how land use in the municipality and meteorological context affected the occurrence of two main pest and pathogen in vineyards: downy mildew (632 fields per year) and grape berry moth (225 fields per year). Our analysis revealed that the probability of occurrence of downy mildew and grape berry moth decreased as the percentage of woodland in the municipality increased. Additionally, we found that the probability of occurrence of downy mildew strongly depended on the meteorological context, as the probability of occurrence of downy mildew increased with the mean rainfall during spring and summer. Our analysis revealed no effect of the share of organic farming vineyard in the municipality on pest pressure. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that diversifying vineyard‐dominated landscapes by increasing the area of woody habitats could limit the occurrence of downy mildew and grape berry moth, which are responsible for most pesticide applications in vineyards. This work provides a significant step forward in the design of pest‐suppressive landscapes that highlight the key role of woody habitat maintenance in vineyard landscapes.

Buckner,"Abstract Pollinating insects are in decline globally, threatening pollination services and driving a growing interest in pollinator monitoring and conservation. However, the implementation of conservation programs for these insects is often hindered by labor‐intensive monitoring methods and insufficient data to assess population trends. We detail a method for surveying and censusing ground nesting bee aggregations, pairing automated UAV image capture with a custom trained computer vision‐based object detection workflow using the YOLOv5m architecture. To highlight the ease of application and accuracy of the workflow, we surveyed a roughly 65 m 2 portion of a large Colletes inaequalis nesting aggregation. We compared the efficiency and performance of our model to manual counts of a technician. Our model detected the location of 1094 nests, representing 88% of the nests present in our test dataset, and a true‐positive rate of 97%. Adjusting for error, our model estimated a total of 1250 nests across the study site, comparable to the total estimated from a manual count of 1259 nests. Our model detected nests 20 times faster than the manual counts while mapping the aggregation with millimetre accuracy. Spatial analyses show that bee nest density was heterogeneous, with dense spatially clustered regions comprised of upwards of 60 nests per m 2 . Synthesis and applications . Our novel application of UAV imagery and object detection models for mapping and censusing ground nesting bee aggregations represents a rapid, cost‐effective solution for overcoming limitations in traditional manual methods. This workflow has applications for bee conservation, management and research such as monitoring bee nesting populations before and after habitat restoration or habitat disruption events, quantifying the impacts of management strategies or repeat censusing of populations over time to determine nesting population demographics and early identification of local extirpation risk.

Müller; Christoph Oberprieler; Kristýna Šemberová; Alena Voltrová; Anna Bucharova; Stefan G. Michalski; Walter Durka,"Abstract Regional seed sources are increasingly used in ecological restoration. Polyploid complexes, i.e. taxa comprising multiple ploidy levels, are often part of regional seed mixtures, where ploidy levels are often not distinguished. However, mixing ploidy levels may foster their hybridisation, severely reduce offspring fitness and disrupt existing patterns of the geographic distribution of individual ploidy levels. Furthermore, ploidy levels may represent distinct genetic lineages. Yet, the exact geographic distribution of the ploidy levels and their genetic differentiation are rarely known. Here, we focus on six polyploid complexes commonly used for the restoration of species‐rich grasslands. We present high‐resolution, national‐scale geographic distributions of their ploidy levels, test their association with environmental gradients and quantify genetic differentiation between ploidy levels. Ploidy levels within polyploid complexes were more differentiated than seed zones within individual ploidy levels. The abundance, spatial distribution and levels of sympatry versus parapatry of ploidy levels varied widely among polyploid complexes. Nevertheless, the spatial distribution of ploidy levels was always associated with environmental gradients. Mixed‐ploidy populations were generally rare. Campanula rotundifolia , Euphorbia cyparissias , and Pimpinella saxifraga showed regional parapatry of ploidy levels, whereas Achillea millefolium agg., Knautia arvensis , and Leucanthemum vulgare agg. showed rather sympatric distribution patterns. Diploid K. arvensis was very rare and potentially non‐native to Germany. Using these datasets as case studies, we present a management decision framework for polyploid complexes in seed zone‐based grassland restoration, requiring only cytotype distribution data that can be acquired at reasonable cost. The framework recommends four different per‐zone management options based on data availability, cytotype presence, distribution, and frequency. Synthesis and applications . Our decision framework enables seed producers and managers to take consistent action on the challenge of polyploid complexes in restoration. Different ploidy levels should not be mixed to avoid fitness losses. Depending on abundance and distribution, either the dominant ploidy level should be prioritised, or multiple ploidy levels need to be managed independently at the seed zone level.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70278

Barbosa,"Abstract A widespread increase in vegetation photosynthetic activity and biomass, known as greening, has been detected since the 1980s. While global climate change explains some of this trend, regional‐level land‐use management also plays a significant role. In grasslands, the fine‐scale movement of livestock is a key driver of vegetation dynamics, likely affecting greening. Here, we investigate how spatial changes in grazing pressure interact with regional climate to determine long‐term vegetation trends. Our study focuses on a Mediterranean mountainous region in southeastern Spain, with a long history of traditional grazing. We used GPS collar data from 35 livestock herds to create a high‐resolution map of herbivory pressure. We then analysed vegetation dynamics from 1985 to 2024 using NDVI time series and evaluated vegetation responses to climate and herbivory with multivariate autoregressive models and logarithmic regressions. Greening was the dominant trend occurring in 90% of the study area. However, increasing grazing pressure diminished this greening tendency. We found a non‐linear response: the greening trend reduced sharply even under low levels of grazing and then stabilised at medium to high intensities. Despite hotspots of grazing pressure, no significant browning (vegetation decline) was detected. Vegetation became more sensitive to climate under higher herbivory pressure. In heavily grazed areas, vegetation greenness responded more strongly to increases in precipitation and showed greater negative responses to rising temperatures. This suggests that grazing regulates how grassland vegetation responds to climatic shifts. Policy implications . Our results show that traditional grazing systems can maintain grassland stability without causing degradation, but they can also increase the ecosystem's vulnerability to climate change. We provide clear evidence that GPS‐based livestock monitoring is a powerful and scalable tool for sustainable rangeland management. It provides land managers with fine‐scale data on grazing pressure, enabling them to identify areas at risk, enhance ecosystem resilience to climate change and support both conservation goals and productive landscapes at local and regional scales.",,,0.75,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70263

Here we examine whether diversification of the editorial board of Journal of Applied Ecology propagates to its reviewer community. Using data from 2004, 2014 and 2024, we constructed tripartite networks linking senior editors, associate editors and reviewers and quantified gender ratios, geographic diversity and network modularity. We also fitted generalized linear mixed models to test whether associate editors preferentially invited reviewers of the same gender or region and whether these patterns changed over time. As associate editors became more gender‐balanced and geographically diverse, reviewer diversity increased: the reviewer gender ratio (number of men divided by number of women) halved, the number of countries represented rose from 33 to 52, and the Simpson's index for geographic diversity increased from 0.60 to 0.75. Network modularity and the number of smaller modules increased, indicating a more segmented and specialized editor–reviewer structure. Men editors showed a declining tendency to invite men reviewers, while women increasingly invited women; only Western European editors showed significant regional homophily, although effect sizes were small. Overall, increased diversity among associate editors was associated with a more globally representative, structurally complex reviewer network. Synthesis and applications .

Ibisch,"Abstract In recent years, wildfires have affected relatively large areas of managed forests in Central Europe. Often, forestry uses intensive post‐fire management practices, which can have negative effects on various components of the ecosystem. Fire ecology has been largely neglected in Central Europe and strategies for appropriate management and successful reforestation of burned areas are urgently needed. We have studied the effects of different post‐fire forest management treatments (including different levels of salvage logging and soil disturbances such as ploughing or raking) on soil parameters (phosphorus, nitrogen, calcium, potassium, magnesium, pH), microclimate (temperatures, vapour pressure deficit (VPD), heat and drought stress), deadwood, regrowth (biomass of tree regeneration, herb and bryophyte layer) and species richness (plants and saproxylic beetles) 3 years after wildfire in a Central European Scots pine forest (northeast Germany). Intensive forest management led to more unfavourable abiotic conditions, including stronger temperature extremes and elevated VPD. Consequently, vegetation on these sites experienced increased heat and drought stress and reduced nutrient availability. The biomass of the herb and bryophyte layer, as well as the species richness of plants and saproxylic beetles, was lower on completely salvage logged sites. Tree biomass recovered on all sites, including sites with intensive forest management. Tree regeneration in our study area was mainly driven by the recolonization of the pioneer species European aspen ( Populus tremula) , which can tolerate a wide range of site conditions. Synthesis and applications . We recommend avoiding intensive management on burned sites, such as complete salvage logging or ploughing, as this creates extreme site conditions that could inhibit the regeneration of more sensitive tree species and result in a long‐term legacy of degradation. In addition, herb and bryophyte layers, as well as the species richness of vegetation and saproxylic beetles, which are important components of forest ecosystems, are negatively affected by intense forest management.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70257

The 2020 megafires in the Brazilian Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland, burned one‐third of its area, causing unprecedented biodiversity impacts and highlighting the need to understand ecological consequences. We assessed the effects of the 2020 megafires on mammal diversity and relative abundance in the Pantanal Matogrossense National Park using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, camera trapping and Bayesian multispecies occupancy models. These methods allowed us to evaluate species, site and assemblage‐level responses to fire, accounting for imperfect detection and landscape heterogeneity. Despite the Pantanal being fire‐prone, we observed significant negative effects on mammals at multiple ecological levels, persisting 2 years post‐fire. Species richness declined from 84 species observed pre‐fire to 44 observed post‐fire. eDNA metabarcoding identified 38 species (23 exclusively), while camera traps recorded 21 species (6 exclusively). A significant negative correlation was found between burned area proportion and both species richness and aggregated relative abundance per site. Impacts were severe on large‐bodied, threatened species, such as the giant armadillo ( Priodontes maximus ), jaguar ( Panthera onca ) and lowland tapir ( Tapirus terrestris ). They experienced significant declines in relative abundance, highlighting the vulnerability of megafauna to severe wildfires. The combination of eDNA and camera trapping proved essential for capturing the full extent of biodiversity impacts in post‐fire landscapes. Synthesis and applications . Our findings highlight the severe and lasting consequences of the 2020 wildfires, observed 2 years after the event, with habitat loss and direct mortality leading to population declines for both forest‐dwelling and open‐habitat species.

Grueber; Tarnya E. Cox; Bernadette Lai; Eleanor Tomkins; Michelle Janes; Jessica Cass; Cassandra Kuner; Carmen Whittaker; Thomas M. Newsome,"Abstract Predation has been widely documented to impact prey behaviour, group dynamics and habitat selection, ultimately influencing individual fitness, population dynamics and even trophic cascades. Such outcomes could also occur when humans manage wildlife populations through lethal control, but lethal control techniques vary widely, making responses by the target species difficult to predict. Aerial or helicopter‐based culling is a common method used to kill animals over a large area, but little is known about how target species respond to the stimuli created by the sight and sound of the helicopter, the sound of gun shots and the disturbance related to conspecifics being shot in proximity. Here, we investigate the effects of aerial culling on invasive fallow deer ( Dama dama ) in an alpine region of south‐east Australia. We used two large‐scale remote camera arrays to monitor fallow deer temporal activity patterns, grouping and movement speed during and outside of aerial control periods. We found that aerial culling did not cause major changes in grouping or movement speed, however, the operations were linked to short term decreases in deer activity, particularly during the day, coupled with relative increases in activity for the dusk and night‐time periods. This suggests that fallow deer were shifting their diel activity patterns towards dusk during aerial culling. Synthesis and applications . Though a common technique employed for the control of medium‐ to large‐bodied invasive species, there is limited research on the effect of aerial culling on the target species from both a population and behavioural standpoint. In our study, aerial control induced short‐term temporal shifts in behaviour, suggesting future research could examine how management efforts can take advantage of this behaviour to achieve sustained population reductions.",,,0.75,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70249
821,Novel positive interactions between invasive species: Widespread mammals disperse a non‐native woody species,,,,,0.0,Journal of Applied Ecology,A,applied_ecology,Melina Jeanette Aranda; Francisco Guerra Aldazabal; María Victoria Piazza; Luis Ignacio Perez,"Abstract Novel ecosystems often emerge from the co‐occurrence of species with no shared evolutionary history, leading to unique and potentially synergistic interactions. Positive interactions between non‐native species can be crucial for successful invasions. In this study, we investigate the novel interaction between two invasive mammals ( Axis axis and Sus scrofa ) and their role as dispersers of the invasive tree species Gleditsia triacanthos . We assessed this dispersal mechanism at a local scale in Entre Ríos, Argentina, by faeces sampling. We analysed the seed content in faeces and performed germination experiments to compare them to non‐consumed seeds. Additionally, using global occurrence data, we mapped the co‐occurrence of both mammal species with G. triacanthos to identify regions of potential synergistic interactions. We estimated a density of 1917 faeces per hectare for A. axis and 267 for S. scrofa . Of the faeces sampled, 56% of A. axis and 37% of S. scrofa faeces contained at least one G. triacanthos seed. The average number of seeds per faeces was 6.8 for deer and 2 for wild boar. Germination experiments confirmed the germination capacity of seeds consumed by both mammals. Global co‐occurrence analysis revealed widespread spatial overlap, with stronger co‐occurrence between G. triacanthos and S. scrofa . Synthesis and applications . Our study provides empirical evidence that management plans should adopt an integrated approach. The movement of invasive animals significantly influences propagule pressure and, given their broad distribution and widespread use of the landscape, merely reducing plant density is insufficient. These animals ensure the dispersal of the few invasive plants that may remain. Therefore, management strategies should not only focus on controlling plant density but also on regulating animal populations, especially those that facilitate the spread of non‐native species. Such integrated management is crucial for preventing the reinforcement of invasive dynamics and improving long‐term control efforts.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70277

However, their ability to persist under changing environmental and climate conditions remains uncertain, particularly in response to combined stress from hydrodynamic forces (currents, waves) and sediment bed erosion. Conducting flume experiments, we evaluated the resistance of three marsh species ( S. tabernaemontani , B. maritimus and P. australis ), which naturally grow along a cross‐shore gradient from high to low hydrodynamic exposure, to combined stress from water flow and sediment erosion. We reveal distinct functional trade‐offs between above‐ground and below‐ground plant traits: species with flexible above‐ground shoots (here: S. tabernaemontani ) avoid hydrodynamic drag‐induced damage to shoots but are prone to uprooting due to shallow below‐ground root systems, while species with rigid stems and deep roots (here P. australis ) resist uprooting and dislodgement but experience higher hydrodynamic drag forces and hence suffer more from structural stem damage. B. maritimus exhibited intermediate traits, maintaining anchorage with minimal shoot damage, aligning with its occurrence at intermediate positions along hydrodynamic and erosion gradients in the field. These findings demonstrate that plant resistance to physical disturbance in tidal marshes arises from a balance between anchorage and mechanical stress avoidance, driven by variation in functional plant traits. Understanding this balance is crucial for predicting species zonation, persistence and the shoreline protection capacity of tidal marshes. Synthesis and applications . Our study highlights the importance of integrating both above‐ and below‐ground plant traits when assessing marsh resistance. Promoting plant species with complementary stress resistance traits along environmental gradients can enhance the shoreline protection functionality of tidal marshes under changing environmental and climate conditions.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70281
823,Beyond urban introduction hubs: Accounting for rural legacies in plant invasions,,,,,0.0,Journal of Applied Ecology,A,applied_ecology,Ingo Kowarik,"Abstract Plant invasions are a growing threat to biodiversity, and effective prevention depends on identifying their underlying drivers. Urban areas are often assumed to be the main sources of non‐native plant introductions and spread, prompting conservation policies that restrict their use in cities to prevent escape into surrounding landscapes. However, the mechanisms driving spread across the urban–rural gradient remain poorly understood. Historical analysis of urban ornamentals that have become widespread invasive species—such as Ailanthus altissima —shows that many invasions attributed to urban escape can originate, at least in part, from rural sources. Plantings for beautification, landscaping, erosion control, timber production and other purposes can substantially increase propagule pressure in rural settings, a key determinant of invasion risk. Spread from such deliberate rural introductions can mimic or reinforce urban‐driven invasions, and may precede them. However, most invasion models estimate propagule pressure indirectly using urban‐based proxies, such as distance from cities. This urban‐centred approach systematically overlooks rural legacy sources, introducing bias into model outputs, inflating perceived spread rates and overstating the role of cities as invasion foci. The ‘Diffuse Legacy Source Model’, established here for deliberately planted species, integrates spatially distributed and historically layered planting data—both urban and rural—into invasion analyses, enabling more accurate attribution of introduction pathways and improving predictive performance. Combining ecological data with cultural‐historical research and other social science perspectives provides a comprehensive basis for evaluating the legacies of past introductions. Synthesis and applications . Addressing both urban and rural planting legacies in invasion models advances understanding of spread dynamics across landscapes. A transdisciplinary approach that links ecological methods with cultural‐historical perspectives is essential for accessing, interpreting and incorporating historical data into predictive tools. Broadening the analytical lens beyond urban sources will enable more spatially informed and historically grounded strategies, improving resource allocation for prevention, targeted management and sustainable use of non‐native plants in both urban and rural contexts.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70273

Dantas; Leonardo de Sousa Miranda; Marina Zanin; Daniela C. Zappi; Yadvinder Malhi; Tereza Cristina Giannini,"Abstract The resilience of biological natural capital in the Amazon is strongly influenced by the functional diversity of multitaxa, which promotes the stability and sustainability of the ecosystem. However, biological natural capital, driven by multiple dimensions of biodiversity, is often underestimated by focusing on the taxonomic dimension, such as richness and abundance. We applied a multitaxa and trait‐based approach to assess how functional diversity supports natural capital. By using a dataset including woody plants, bees, frugivorous butterflies and songbirds, we created two indices: Biological Natural Capital Resilience (BNCR), the proportion of biological assets needed to maintain natural capital integrity, and Biological Natural Capital Uniqueness (BNCU), the proportion of natural capital sustained by species' functional uniqueness. BNCR results show that, in general, more than 80% of biological assets to maintain the integrity of natural capital, and that the BNCR index reached the highest value when all taxonomical groups are combined. These results reveal that natural capital strongly depends on biological assets and underscore the importance of multitaxa approaches for assessing ecosystem resilience. BNCU values show that a substantial portion of natural capital integrity (from 46.22% to 64.23%) depends on a small subset of functionally unique species, indicating that the loss of few species, which play irreplaceable ecological roles, rapidly reduces ecosystem functioning. Synthesis and applications . This study presents a trait‐based framework integrating functional diversity into biological natural capital accounting, capturing both ecosystem resilience and species uniqueness across multiple taxa. It provides ecologically grounded, standardized and reproducible indicators that move beyond single‐taxon or purely taxonomic approaches. By embedding these indicators into natural capital accounts, the framework supports conservation prioritization, restoration planning, impact assessment, trend monitoring and scenario testing, offering a practical methodology to evaluate and manage the multiple dimensions of biodiversity within natural capital assessments.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70269
827,Intelligent tinkering: Do active restoration treatments promote initial ecosystem recovery after narrow linear disturbances in forested boreal fens?,,,,,0.0,Journal of Applied Ecology,A,applied_ecology,Colleen M. Sutheimer; Scott E. Nielsen,"Abstract Across forested boreal peatlands in western Canada, forestry and energy development disturb threatened Woodland caribou habitat. Federal policy requires ≥65% undisturbed habitat in caribou ranges. Practitioners are starting to restore a ubiquitous footprint, conventional seismic lines—narrow forest clearings (3–10 m wide) used for oil and gas exploration. Research has assessed tree growth and peatland surface responses to seismic line restoration separately but rarely together, creating uncertainty about which practices most benefit ecosystem recovery. A more inclusive view of restoration that embraces intelligent tinkering by considering multiple structural responses, rather than a narrow focus on one response such as forest cover, is needed for Woodland caribou habitat recovery. Here, we used an intelligent tinkering framework to analyse dominant tree (black spruce and tamarack), woody shrub and peatland surface responses simultaneously to identify whether active (inverted mounding and tree planting) relative to passive (inhibit re‐disturbance and leave for natural) restoration promotes initial ecosystem recovery on seismic lines. We sampled and compared dominant tree, woody shrub and peatland surface responses on seismic lines and in reference adjacent fens 8–11 years after restoration treatments in the Cold Lake woodland caribou range of north‐eastern Alberta, Canada. We used generalized linear mixed‐effects models to compare structural responses for forested poor fens (20.2% of the Cold Lake range) and forested rich fens (17.3%) between restoration treatments and adjacent reference fens. Applying intelligent tinkering by comparing multiple structural responses, we found that active restoration did not promote initial recovery of forested fens more than a simple passive restoration strategy. Active restoration increased tree density and height, likely due to tree planting, but tree growth was not expedited compared to naturally regenerating trees in passive restoration. Seismic lines in active restoration treatments had reduced bryophyte coverage, increased open water and exposed soil and decreased hummock density relative to passive restoration and reference fens due to larger, man‐made mounds with little bryophyte coverage and open water pools. Synthesis and applications. Intelligent tinkering can identify divergent structural responses to active and passive restoration treatments that inhibit ecosystem recovery. Consideration of all structural responses to adapt restoration practices is not just needed within Woodland caribou ranges but is needed across peatland restoration, globally. Intelligent tinkering in restoration supports adaptive, evidence‐based restoration practices and policies that increase the likelihood of ecosystem recovery.",,,0.7,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70272

Barnes; Xiaoyun Chen; Feng Hu; Akira S. Mori; Manqiang Liu,"Abstract Plant litter retention is increasingly recognized as an effective strategy for restoring soil biodiversity and related functions in agroecosystems. However, how litter stoichiometry (e.g. carbon‐to‐nitrogen, C:N) influences soil biodiversity across multiple trophic groups and their assembly mechanisms remains poorly understood. To inform crop residue management for biodiversity conservation, we investigated the diversity and assembly processes of soil bacteria, fungi and nematodes (i.e. bacterivores, fungivores and predators) in a field experiment where six types of plant litter were manipulated to create a broad gradient of litter C:N stoichiometry. We particularly focused on community β‐diversity, which is important in capturing the variability in species composition among different locations. The results revealed that with increasing litter C:N stoichiometry, the β‐diversity of microbivores declined and that of predators slightly increased, contrasting with the fluctuating patterns in microbial β‐diversity, thereby leading to greater community homogenization at higher trophic groups with larger body sizes. The community assembly of soil microorganisms (bacteria, fungi) was mostly influenced by stochastic processes, whereas that of soil nematodes (bacterivores, fungivores and predators) was more deterministic, with soil nutrients and habitat (i.e. soil moisture and aggregates) serving as key environmental drivers. The importance of selection processes relative to stochastic processes increased with organism body size and became more pronounced with increasing litter C:N ratio. Synthesis and applications . Our results suggest that litter C:N ratio exerts contrasting effects on community assembly across multiple trophic groups of different body sizes, emphasizing the need to incorporate life‐history traits into biodiversity conservation strategies. These findings provide a robust applied field test of ecological theory linking litter stoichiometry to biodiversity conservation and management.",,,0.6,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/1365-2664.70276

Rakowski,"ABSTRACT Environmental crimes pose harms and risks to socioecological systems, driving biodiversity loss. A 2024 resolution at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime prompted stakeholders to discuss a new international framework for addressing crimes that affect the environment. Advocates say existing multilateral efforts are insufficient for addressing environmental crime; opponents say creating a new framework could dilute efforts to reduce environmental harms, and other approaches are more suitable for the nuances of environmental crime. These debates encouraged us to probe the concept of positive criminology for environmental crime. We review the concept and present key theories informing the harm‐reduction processes central to positive criminology's theory of change. Five positive criminology inputs have touchpoints with conservation that could result in desired outcomes and impacts for harm reduction, halting and reversing loss of biodiversity: community policing, crime desistance, problem‐solving courts, restorative justice, and strength‐based programs. Regardless of whether the framework is updated or includes environmental crime, positive criminology is an intriguing theory of change with broad potential applicability to conservation policy and practice focused on halting and reversing loss of biodiversity.",,,0.75,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/con4.70024

This paper provides a qualitative systematic review of academic literature on “masculinities”—actions, norms, and values associated with men—in the conservation sector and synthesizes the reported effects of masculinities on conservation science, policy, and practice. We adopt a performative and intersectionality‐inspired approach, recognizing that masculinities may be performed by men, women, nonbinary, and gender‐diverse people, and that gender interacts with other dimensions of identity such as race, age, and (dis)ability. We found that the current literature primarily reports conservation masculinities performed by White men in Global North and settler‐colonial contexts. The most common actions and norms were the exercise of control/authority, rationalism, and strength, and the most common effects were the marginalization of others, prioritization of natural sciences over other knowledge, and support for policies such as protected areas and militarization. Explicitly addressing the dominance of such masculinities, as well as the conditions through which their dominance is enabled and rewarded, may contribute towards gender equality and to more just and effective forms of conservation.",,,0.7,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/con4.70007

Sonter; Alexandra Marques,"ABSTRACT Mining is a significant driver of biodiversity loss, with impacts expected to escalate due to rising metal demand for the energy transition. However, global assessments of mining impacts are still in their infancy, as global biodiversity models overlook many relevant impact pathways. Here, we present a comprehensive synthesis of the biodiversity impact pathways of mining to inform the conservation and modeling community, as well as the policies and corporate actions to address these impacts. Our review highlights pollution, primarily driven by the disposal of reactive waste materials, as the most diverse pathway, especially in freshwater ecosystems, where acid mine drainage, heavy metal contamination, and sedimentation result in significant ecological impairment. Mining‐induced habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and hydrological disruptions further exacerbate biodiversity loss. To improve the representation of mining impacts in biodiversity models, we recommend incorporating pollution effects and refining the representation of physical habitat change effects. Future modeling efforts should also consider cumulative and interactive effects to ensure comprehensive impact estimation.

It has been successful in establishing new EU environmental policy instruments, with a strong focus on sustainable land use and conservation, such as the EU Nature Restoration Law or the EU Deforestation Regulation. Recently, however, the Green Deal has lost political traction, and its sustainable land use and conservation‐oriented policy instruments are under pressure or have already been cut back. In this paper, we undertake a multidisciplinary assessment of the Green Deal, presenting four theoretical perspectives (policy analysis, international relations, political economy/macroeconomics, and political ecology). These perspectives provide a so far missing comprehensive analysis of the strategic situation of EU land use and conservation policy, rooted in complementary explanations for the emergence, evolution, and faltering of the Green Deal.

This study proposes and empirically validates a novel model that enhances conservation agency through sense of place (SOP) and promotes pro‐nature conservation behavior (ProCoB). Focusing on Bryde's whale conservation at Weizhou Island, China, a 3‐month educational program engaged 110 adolescents through lectures, participatory activities, and advocacy initiatives. Results revealed significant and sustained increases in conservation agency and behavior, especially among those involved in volunteer advocacy. Structural equation modeling showed that SOP directly boosted agency, which in turn promoted behavior, while subjective norms also contributed to increased agency. The model explained 65.8% of the variance in agency and 30.7% in behavior.

This limits their practical utility and wide adoption by ecologists. We present flatbug , an open‐source Python package developed to provide a robust, generalizable and user‐friendly solution for arthropod detection and instance segmentation. flatbug employs an adaptive tiling framework for both training and inference, enabling scale‐ and size‐agnostic detection. It leverages instance segmentation, allowing for automated background removal and precise body‐size estimation. The package includes pre‐trained models and is accompanied by a uniquely diverse benchmark dataset of over 113,000 annotated arthropods from laboratory‐ and field‐based imaging systems. This dataset facilitates rigorous cross‐validation and evaluation. Our best flatbug model achieves an average F1 score of 94.2% across these diverse datasets.

Through this framework, we gain an opportunity to identify ecosystems likely to develop novel properties in the future. The framework distinguishes among four key dimensions of novelty: compositional (species identity and community structure), functional (traits and ecosystem processes), abiotic (environmental conditions) and social (human interactions with, and perceptions of, nature).

HOAMs are suitable for sampling approaches that produce detection histories from repeated visits to the same sites, including direct observations (e.g. bird point counts), indirect observations (e.g. tracks, dung) and remote and passive sensors (e.g. camera traps, acoustic recorders). Wildlife often exhibits non‐linear temporal trends or threshold‐like responses to environmental conditions. However, traditional HOAMs address non‐linearity crudely using global polynomial functions, despite well‐documented limitations. Generalised additive models (GAMs) provide a more flexible approach to non‐linearity, allowing smooth data‐driven estimation through basis functions and penalised splines. Yet, GAMs have remained sparsely adopted in hierarchical occupancy modelling, in part due to the need for custom code in Bayesian modelling languages. We demonstrate the applicability of GAMs within the occupancy and abundance modelling framework (hereafter ‘OccuGAMs’) by comparing traditional HOAMs with polynomials to OccuGAMs. In simulations, OccuGAMs recovered non‐linear relationships more accurately and more often, scoring better on energy and variogram metrics and produced more stable responses at smaller sample sizes. Polynomials performed well in some scenarios but were less generalisable, making OccuGAMs the more robust overall choice, especially when there is no a priori guidance about the functional form. Limitations of OccuGAMs include interpretability of model parameters and sensitivity to the choice and number of basis functions, which can be assessed with diagnostic tools. To promote wider accessibility, we provide code for OccuGAM implementation in JAGS and Stan as well as in the R packages flocker and mvgam .",,,0.7,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/2041-210x.70252

While multiple ecosystem functions or time points can be analysed separately, it is often desirable to formally compare across the functions or time points. This requires covariances between the multiple measurements from the same study unit to be explicitly captured in the modelling framework. We present DImodelsMulti , an R package that complements and extends DImodels . It enables the fitting of multivariate or repeated measures DI models in a user‐friendly way. For multivariate data, fitted models can be used to predict for each ecosystem function, and the relative importance of model predictors can be assessed by comparing across the multiple responses. For repeated measures data, fitted models can be used to predict at each time point, and temporal patterns can be formally assessed and tested.",,,0.4,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/2041-210x.70251

Although large‐scale digitization has expanded access to specimen images, extracting label metadata remains a major bottleneck, typically requiring time‐intensive manual transcription. We developed ELIE (Entomological Label Information Extraction), a modular, semi‐automated pipeline that integrates computer vision methods (including convolutional neural networks), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and clustering algorithms to streamline label data extraction. The workflow proceeds in three stages: (1) label detection and text‐type classification (printed vs. handwritten), (2) OCR‐based text extraction from printed labels using Tesseract or Google Vision, and (3) clustering of extracted text for deduplication and targeted human validation. Benchmarking across three institutional data sets demonstrated that ELIE accurately extracted and clustered up to 98% of printed labels, achieving 94% detection accuracy and reducing manual transcription effort by up to 87%. The pipeline markedly improves the efficiency of digitization workflows while maintaining high data integrity. By integrating AI‐driven automation with minimal human oversight, ELIE enables scalable, cross‐institutional digitization of entomological collections. Its implementation holds the potential to unlock large volumes of biodiversity data for research in ecology, systematics, and conservation worldwide.",,,0.5,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/2041-210x.70235

Currently established molecular methods for biomonitoring rely heavily on classic metabarcoding utilising short reads, mostly through Illumina data. However, increasingly more studies use long‐read sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), for analyses of environmental DNA (eDNA) and DNA barcoding. These long‐read sequencing approaches can be advantageous over existing methods by providing increased information content and opening new avenues for understanding biodiversity at a larger scale. In this review, we provide an overview of studies to date using long‐read sequencing platforms for biodiversity analyses of eukaryotes, from eDNA and community metabarcoding, shotgun sequencing, and DNA barcoding. We also give detailed information on each step required for sample processing, data generation and analysis of long‐read sequencing datasets for biodiversity applications. Even though the number of studies using long‐read sequencing technologies is rapidly increasing, clear established guidelines for sample preparation or analysis of such datasets are lacking. Furthermore, a side‐by‐side review for both ONT and PacBio technologies across different applications has not been presented. Long‐read sequencing platforms provide possibilities for metabarcoding (PCR‐based) of both short and long fragments, shotgun sequencing (PCR‐free), or DNA barcoding. ONT platforms, in particular, can also allow real‐time data acquisition, while the portability of the MinION instrument can support sequencing in the field. PacBio, on the other hand, can provide highly accurate reads and can be used to reliably address open questions in ecology and evolution for difficult‐to‐characterise taxa such as microeukaryotes. Streamlining the use of these technologies could enable sequencing of whole organelles or population‐level assessments from environmental samples, which would be a step change for DNA‐based monitoring. Here, we review existing applications, applied methodology, and future perspectives in the field. Overall, we aim to facilitate the use of long‐read sequencing technologies by the wider community, promote best practices for data generation and standardised data reporting that supports reproducibility, and to encourage open data policies and tools.",,,0.4,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/2041-210x.70250
848,(De)composing sociality: Disentangling individual‐specific from dyad‐specific propensities to interact,,,,,0.0,Methods in Ecology and Evolution,A,applied_ecology,Christof Neumann; Julia Fischer,"Abstract In group‐living animals, relationships between group members are often highly differentiated. Some dyads can maintain strong and long‐lasting relationships, while others are only connected by weak or fleeting ties. More and more studies show that aspects of social relationships are related to reproductive success and survival. Yet, in the field of animal ecology, few of these studies have considered that frequent or prolonged affiliative interactions between two individuals can be principally driven by two distinct processes: namely, the overall gregariousness of individuals and dyadic affinity, that is, the preference the members of the dyad have to interact specifically with one another. Crucially, these two axes of sociality cannot be observed directly, although distinguishing between them is essential for many research questions, such as when estimating kin bias or studying the link between sociality and fitness. In this work, we present an accessible and principled account of how to estimate these two underlying sociality axes as defined above using dyadic interaction data aimed at animal ecologists. We also provide a lean R package bamoso , which implements models based on the proposed framework and allows visual and numerical evaluation of the estimated sociality axes. We demonstrate critical features of the proposed modelling framework with simulated and empirical data aimed at facilitating understanding of relationships: (1) the possibility of checking model fit against observed data, (2) the assessment of uncertainty in the estimated sociality parameters and (3) the possibility to extend it to more complex models that use interaction data to estimate the relationship between individual‐level social features and individual‐level outcomes in a unified model. Our model provides a simple and principled foundation to explain variation in dyadic interactions, which can be extended to reflect more complex processes using existing modelling frameworks and tools. This approach allows us to address questions about the link between variation in sociality characteristics and other features of interest, both within and across species.",,,0.5,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/2041-210x.70239

To support the urgent business transformations required to achieve Nature Positive goals, decision‐makers, investors, lenders and other stakeholders need consistent, comparable and decision‐useful information on the state of nature and the benefits it provides. This paper presents a conceptual framework for natural capital accounting (NCA), adapting principles from financial accounting to support transparent reporting on business interactions with nature. We propose a set of structured statements— Natural Capital Balance Sheets , Natural Capital Income Statements, and Ecosystem Change Statements— that report on stocks of natural capital and associated ecosystem service flows. This approach is novel in its application of double‐entry financial accounting principles to ecological assets, liabilities and equity, offering a structured method for tracking organisational stewardship of nature. The framework builds on established financial reporting practices and aligns with global statistical standards such as the United Nations System of Environmental‐Economic Accounting (SEEA). A hypothetical example demonstrates how the framework can be applied to track changes in ecosystem condition and assess progress towards Nature Positive commitments. This work provides a foundation for mainstreaming NCA as a tool for ecological accountability. Further research is needed to operationalise the framework, refine ecological metrics and integrate NCA into governance and reporting systems.

Guillaume Blanchet,"Abstract With increased access to data and the advent of computers, the use of statistical tools and numerical simulations is becoming commonplace for ecologists. These approaches help improve our understanding of ecological phenomena and their underlying mechanisms in increasingly complex environments. However, the development of mathematical and computational tools has made it possible to study high‐dimensional problems up to a certain limit. To overcome this issue, quantum computers could be used to study ecological problems on a larger scale by creating new bridges between fields that at first glance appear to be quite different. We offer an elementary guide to quantum computing, introducing core concepts such as qubits, superposition, entanglement and quantum advantage to give ecologists the foundations needed to appreciate its relevance and potential. Our perspective highlights that quantum computing could enhance the power of statistical tools, tackle intractable problems in ecological networks and capture the dynamics of large systems of interacting species more efficiently than classical approaches. By bringing a computational perspective grounded in quantum technologies, this work opens new opportunities for ecology: redefining our understanding of species interactions, improving predictive models of biodiversity distributions and optimizing conservation strategies. Quantum computing thus has the potential to transform ecological research and guide the field towards a new era of discovery and insight.",,,0.7,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/2041-210x.70236

Murry; Christopher T. Rota; Laura C. Gigliotti; Caroline C. Arantes,"Abstract Species occurrence is often influenced by changes in environmental conditions at multiple spatial and temporal scales working simultaneously in a hierarchical fashion. While previous dynamic multi‐scale occupancy modelling frameworks address dynamics at multiple spatial scales, they assume both large‐scale and small‐scale units are closed during the same period, potentially leading to bias in small‐scale estimates. We present an extended robust design that allows for the estimation of colonization and persistence probabilities across three spatiotemporal scales (large‐scale annual, small‐scale annual and small‐scale intra‐annual) simultaneously, while also accounting for imperfect detection in a Bayesian framework. We specified latent variables in a hierarchical manner, where occurrence at each scale was dependent on higher‐level latent variables. To test model performance under a variety of sampling scenarios, we simulated data across 22 data‐generating designs. As an example, we also fit the novel occupancy model to invasive Silver Carp ( Hypophthalmichthys molitrix ) detection/non‐detection data collected in the Ohio River Basin, USA. We found that the model generally performed well, even under limited replication across different scales. Model performance declined in more ‘extreme’ simulations where colonization or persistence was rare. We found that invasive carp turnover probability varied across a gradient of invasion as well as across all spatiotemporal scales, exemplifying the benefits of utilizing our multi‐scale approach. This modelling framework offers a powerful tool for disentangling the multi‐scale processes that drive species distributions across time. The model was able to identify trends in carp occurrence even with limited data and uneven sampling efforts that would have otherwise been masked by more traditional occupancy modelling approaches. Annual large‐scale and small‐scale turnover varied substantially by river section, but intra‐annual turnover was constantly low throughout the entire study area. By explicitly modelling dynamic parameters at multiple scales, this approach fills a critical gap in ecological modelling, providing the resolution to detect fine‐scale processes and the scope to inform broad‐scale management.",,,0.6,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/2041-210x.70232

Typically, SDMs relate species occurrences to environmental variables representing abiotic factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and soil properties. However, species distributions are also strongly influenced by biotic interactions with other species, which are often overlooked in traditional models. While some methods, such as joint species distribution models (JSDMs), partially address this limitation by incorporating biotic interactions, they often assume symmetrical pairwise relationships between species and require consistent co‐occurrence data. In practice, species observations are often sparse, and the availability of information about the presence or absence of other species varies significantly across locations. To address these challenges, we propose CISO, a deep learning‐based method for species distribution modelling Conditioned on Incomplete Species Observations. CISO enables predictions to be conditioned on a flexible number of species observations alongside environmental variables, accommodating the variability and incompleteness of available biotic data. We demonstrate our approach using three datasets representing different species groups: sPlotOpen for plants, SatBird for birds, and a new dataset, SatButterfly, for butterflies. Our results show that including partial biotic information improves predictive performance on spatially separate test sets. When conditioned on a subset of species within the same dataset, CISO outperforms alternative methods in predicting the distribution of the remaining species for plants and birds. Furthermore, we show that combining and conditioning on observations from multiple datasets can improve the prediction of species occurrences in scenarios with sufficient co‐occurrences between datasets to train CISO effectively. Our results show that CISO is a promising ecological tool, capable of incorporating incomplete biotic information and identifying potential interactions between species from disparate taxa.",,,0.6,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/2041-210x.70238
853,Inferring state‐dependent diversification rates using approximate Bayesian computation,,,,,0.0,Methods in Ecology and Evolution,A,applied_ecology,Shu Xie; Luis Valente; Rampal S. Etienne,"Abstract State‐dependent speciation and extinction (SSE) models are a popular framework for quantifying whether species traits have an impact on evolutionary rates and how this shapes the variation in species richness among clades in a phylogeny. However, SSE models are becoming increasingly complex, limiting the application of likelihood‐based inference methods. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a likelihood‐free approach, is a potentially powerful alternative for estimating parameters. Here, we develop an ABC framework to estimate state‐dependent speciation, extinction and transition rates from phylogenetic trees in BiSSE (binary state dependent speciation and extinction), GeoSSE (geographic state dependent speciation and extinction) and MuSSE (multiple state‐dependent speciation and extinction) models. Using different sets of candidate summary statistics, we then compare the inference ability of ABC with that of using likelihood‐based maximum likelihood (ML) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to identify the combinations that best capture the complex relationships between rates of diversification and species traits. Our results show the ABC algorithm can accurately estimate state‐dependent diversification rates for most of the model parameter sets we explored. The inference error of the parameters associated with the species‐poor state is larger with ABC than in the likelihood estimations only when the speciation rate ( λ ) is highly asymmetric between states in all three models. We suggest that the combination of normalized lineage‐through‐time (nLTT) statistics and phylogenetic signal constitutes efficient summary statistics for the ABC method. By providing an efficient algorithm and a set of suitable summary statistics, our work aims to contribute to the use of the ABC approach in the development of complex SSE models, for which a likelihood is not available.",,,0.5,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/2041-210x.70240

Ultrasonic monitoring is essential for ecological studies of bats and other animals, yet high‐performance field devices remain prohibitively expensive and inaccessible—particularly in biodiversity‐rich regions with limited research infrastructure. Existing low‐cost options often lack real‐time listening and recording features. There remains a critical need for versatile, affordable and field‐ready tools that support acoustic behavioural research, educational and conservation outreach. New tool . I introduce Esperdyne , an open‐source, dual‐channel ultrasound monitoring and recording system based on the ESP32‐S3 microcontroller. With a component cost under €75, Esperdyne combines real‐time heterodyne monitoring, stereo recording from a retroactive ring buffer, and an intuitive rotary‐based user interface with OLED display. It supports full‐duplex 192 kHz audio, dual‐band tuning for simultaneous frequency‐modulated/constant‐frequency monitoring, and real‐time playback via headphones or a speaker. All audio processing—including adjustable carrier frequency mixing, gain control and file‐saving logic—is implemented without reliance on fixed‐rate audio libraries. Applications . Esperdyne has been tested in field conditions and shown to reliably detect high‐SNR calls and harmonics from free‐flying bats. A companion tool Bat Reviewer supports rapid inspection, playback and export of selected recordings. Together, these tools enable portable, solo‐operated acoustic surveys with minimal training. Beyond ecological research, Esperdyne is suitable for education, outreach, and preliminary field assessments in remote or resource‐constrained settings. Its modular design encourages hardware customisation and firmware extension by interdisciplinary teams. Availability and implementation . Full hardware schematics, firmware and software tools are publicly available. The system can be built using hobbyist‐accessible components and standard Arduino tooling. By sharing this system openly, I aim to lower technical barriers and foster broader participation in ultrasound‐based biodiversity monitoring and conservation. Esperdyne demonstrates how microcontroller‐based platforms can bridge gaps between affordability, usability and scientific capability—supporting global efforts in soundscape ecology.",,,0.6,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/2041-210x.70241

Due to its cost‐effectiveness and non‐invasiveness, PAM is becoming a promising approach for studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of large groups in response to environmental changes. However, conventional PAM can face significant constraints in dealing with the collective vocalisations of organisms. Here, we extend the traditional sound propagation equation for targeting a collectively vocalising group and propose a state‐space model that estimates the acoustic group's location and size with a limited number of microphones. These developments overcome traditional limitations, such as financial, operational and methodological costs and problems associated with the use of numerous microphones. Simulation studies confirmed that the model produced systematically unbiased estimates of acoustic group size and location across varying group parameters. Furthermore, the estimations of the acoustic group locations were robust to a violation of the model assumption that the spatial extent of the acoustic group is temporally constant. As an empirical demonstration, applying the proposed approach to white croaker ( Pennahia argentata ) tracked the daily movement of the acoustic group centre in relation to tidal conditions. Moreover, the approach not only revealed temporal variations in acoustic group size with a 10‐min resolution but also revealed temporal shifts in the peak timing of choruses. These findings demonstrate the potential for novel biological insights. The proposed approach enables long‐term and comprehensive assessment of biological status and supports effective resource management through spatiotemporally fine‐scale predictions of future distribution and abundance. Moreover, this approach can be applied to collectively vocalising groups across a wide range of taxonomic groups, including birds, insects and amphibians, even when using a limited number of microphones.",,,0.4,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/2041-210x.70230

Yet, their ecology and biogeography are poorly understood, despite being necessary to predict microbial responses to future climate change. Here, we provide the first large‐scale floristic and biogeographic study of the moss diatom flora in the tundra regions of the North Atlantic sector of the Arctic. Diatom communities in 284 terrestrial moss samples from herbarium and recent collections (1962–2023) were analysed by light and scanning electron microscopy. Moss diatoms show clear regionalisation across the Arctic, with strong compositional differences between the three biogeographic regions (High Arctic, Low Arctic and Subarctic), reflecting contemporary microclimatic conditions and historical processes. We identified an inverse latitudinal diversity gradient with species richness increasing towards the High Arctic, likely driven by a temperature–moisture gradient. Nearly half of all taxa in our study are currently only observed in and known from the Arctic, and 44% were confined to a single biogeographic region, indicating a high degree of potential endemism.

Bell,"Temperate mesophotic ecosystems (TMEs) have the potential to act as climate refugia for shallower benthic species impacted by environmental change. However, the extent to which mesophotic ecosystems might provide an ecological refuge, particularly for key functional groups like sponges, remains poorly known in temperate systems. Our study investigates sponge assemblage structure across a depth gradient at the Poor Knights Islands Marine Reserve, New Zealand, to assess the potential for mesophotic depths to act as ecological refuges for species inhabiting shallow water in the scenarios where mesophotic depths avoid shallower disturbances. Using ROV and SCUBA‐based image surveys across three sites, sponge abundance data were collected from depths spanning 5 to 65 m. Assemblage composition, species richness, and depth‐dependent abundance patterns were analysed using nMDS, PERMANOVA, and linear regression. Results revealed high beta diversity across depths, with sponge assemblages strongly structured by depth. The majority of sponge operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were restricted to either shallow (&lt; 30 m) or mesophotic (&gt; 30 m) zones, with between 26.4 and 32.7% of OTUs shared between both, and a total of 18 sponge OTUs found in multiple depths in each zone across all three sites. Depth related abundance patterns tended to be species specific, meaning the potential for any refuge effect will likely also vary between species depending on their local abundance. Our findings highlight the vertical structuring of sponge assemblages and suggest that, while TMEs may offer some refuge potential to specific species in scenarios where mesophotic habitats avoid disturbances experienced by shallow species, the benefits won't apply to entire sponge assemblages.",,,0.5,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecog.08250

We examined how climate, vegetation structure, and associated environmental gradients influence cricket communities (Orthoptera: Ensifera) in disturbed tropical rainforests of North Queensland, Australia. Using richness, abundance‐weighted diversity, community ordination, and trait‐based analyses, we assessed taxonomic and functional responses to variation in forest structure and climate. We used crickets as a model taxon due to their high local endemism, sensitivity to microhabitat conditions, and value as indicators of environmental change in tropical ecosystems. Species richness increased with precipitation and aboveground biomass, the latter reflecting differences in disturbance and forest recovery, and both explained the greatest variation in community composition. Trait–environment associations showed that flightlessness increased with elevation, tree density, and latitude. Acoustic species were associated with higher aboveground biomass, while smaller, non‐acoustic species declined with biomass and elevation. These results show that climate and disturbance‐driven changes in vegetation structure can influence invertebrate communities, producing functionally distinct assemblages with altered dispersal and acoustic signalling, and highlight the value of trait‐based approaches for understanding biodiversity responses to environmental change.",,,0.5,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecog.08451

Thorson; Curtis Deutsch,"Species' ranges are shifting in response to increasing temperature and decreasing oxygen in coastal oceans. Predicting these shifts is limited by information on physiological oxygen thresholds and how they depend on temperature. Here we collate laboratory‐derived measurements of a common oxygen threshold, p crit , for 148 animal species that span six phyla, and fit a hierarchical model based on taxonomy to impute threshold values for all based on taxonomy, body size, and environmental temperature. As expected, p crit increased with increasing temperature and body size, and these temperature‐ and body size effects were broadly similar among species. Generally, variation in p crit measurements was estimated to be most pronounced at the taxonomic family and species level, although the partitioning of variance was relatively imprecise. We demonstrate application of these estimates for species distribution modeling of six groundfish species that reside in the coastal waters of the US and Canadian Pacific coast, finding that models that used imputed values sometimes – but not always – improved the performance of species distribution models compared to models that use environmental pO 2 alone.

However, climate change may disrupt this mutualism in unprecedented ways by altering truffle‐like ECM sporing body production and mycophagous mammal diets, with consequences for fungal spore dispersal and ECM host plant health. As one of the most specialised mycophagous mammals in the world, the endangered marsupial long‐footed potoroo Potorous longipes provides a powerful model system to investigate these risks. Using a unique 23‐year collection of long‐footed potoroo scats from south‐eastern Australia, we quantified the diversity and composition of truffle‐like ECM fungi in their diet and assessed how it was shaped by intra‐ and inter‐annual shifts in temperature and precipitation. ITS2 metabarcoding of scats revealed a high richness of truffle‐like ECM fungi in long‐footed potoroo scats, with a total of 38 taxa from 14 genera. The richness of truffle‐like ECM fungi consumed by long‐footed potoroos was negatively correlated with higher minimum temperatures of the previous quarter and 12 months, and was highest in spring. Seasonality, precipitation, minimum temperature and aridity were the best predictors of truffle‐like ECM fungal community composition in long‐footed potoroo scats. We found that five truffle‐like ECM fungal genera – Mesophellia , Hysterangium, Arcangeliella, Thaxterogaster and Austrogautieria – were associated with specific climate conditions related to temperature and precipitation, providing novel insights into their phenology and dispersal. Our findings suggest that mycophagous mammals may consume far less diverse fungal diets in a warmer and drier future, with a greater reliance on truffle‐like ECM fungal genera associated with these conditions such as Mesophellia .

Habitat suitability estimates from species distribution models (SDMs) could be used to represent species density and overcome the scarcity of density data. However, there is mixed evidence that habitat suitability is a reliable descriptor of density, and it is suggested that local dynamics affect the relationship between habitat suitability and density. We simulated population dynamics for 200 virtual species considering different combinations of factors (demographic stochasticity, dispersal, and intraspecific competition) that affect population sizes and SDMs were trained using different sets of environmental predictors to evaluate when habitat suitability reflects densities. We also examined the generalities of these relationships in nature considering 200 North American bird species sampled by the Breeding Bird Survey. We found that even when population growth rate and demographic stochasticity were the only factors driving population dynamics and SDMs are trained with the two environmental factors that controlled population density, habitat suitability was not consistently related to virtual species densities. Incorporating dispersal dynamics and spatial differences in intraspecific competition had negative effects on the relationship between habitat suitability and density, showing that these factors influence these relationships. Similarly, habitat suitability could not explain the density of North American birds. Together, our results suggest that the use of habitat suitability estimates from SDMs to understand population densities should be avoided as habitat suitability does not relate to density under many scenarios.",,,0.6,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecog.08299

This shift raises crucial questions about their capacity to express adaptive antipredator behaviours. Using a quasi‐experimental camera‐trap design, we examined diel activity responses of ungulates along the ongoing wolf recolonisation in the south‐eastern Alps. Red deer showed higher summer diurnality in sites with a longer history of wolf presence (7% increase over five years, on average) and progressively reduced nocturnality within sites as local wolf establishment advanced (5% decrease per year, on average), also heightening activity overlap with humans. This ‘diel shield effect' disappeared when human hunting occurred. Roe deer and Alpine chamois did not exhibit significant diel activity shifts in relation to wolves, though both species responded to human disturbance, with roe deer adjusting activity to hunting (18% less diurnal, on average) and chamois reducing diurnality in areas of intense outdoor use (up to 38% difference in diurnality between undisturbed and highly disturbed areas). Red deer, too, were less diurnal (up to 27% difference) and more nocturnal (up to 37% difference) in such highly disturbed areas, as well as near human settlements (up to 42% difference in diurnality between remote areas and villages). Our findings show that wolf recovery can induce detectable diel activity shifts in large herbivores over relatively short timescales, yet responses depend on species biology and behavioural plasticity.

Microhabitats provide refuge for species, thereby reducing exposure to thermal and hydric stress under climate change. Using a mechanistic modelling approach, we assessed how microhabitat variability and physiological traits influence activity behaviour, time spent in preferred temperature, shade selection, and water loss under different climate change scenarios on two green lizard species. We classified study area microhabitats using high‐resolution geospatial data and applied biophysical models to simulate organismal responses under current and future climate change scenarios (+2°C and +4°C). We first calibrated microhabitat‐specific microclimate models using field data and adjusting key parameters that determine surface energy balance and soil heat transfer, including surface roughness height, substrate longwave emissivity, and soil density. We then performed steady‐state ectotherm models and extracted physiological responses such as foraging and basking times, times spent in preferred temperature, selected shade, and water loss under current and projected climate scenarios. Our results revealed differences between species in terms of thermoregulatory and water‐loss dynamics: Timon lepidus showed higher foraging and basking activity, particularly in open rocky microhabitats. In contrast, Lacerta schreiberi relied more on shaded vegetated microhabitats and exhibited higher size‐corrected evaporative water loss. Foraging activity in T. lepidus increased in low‐slope areas, whereas L. schreiberi foraged more in steeper microhabitats, where both species also selected greater shade. Activity increased on south/west slopes, while shade selection was greater on north/west slopes. Activity periods may increase under warming conditions, but this may come at the cost of higher selected shade and water loss. These results go beyond recognizing the buffering role of microhabitats in climate change, by linking fine‐scale thermal and hydric variation to physiological strategies of lizard species. By integrating microclimate and ectotherm models, our work illustrates how species‐specific traits interact with microhabitat heterogeneity to shape differential vulnerability under warming conditions.",,,0.5,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecog.08337

It has been suggested that species diversity throughout Amazonia generally increases westward toward the Andes, but this pattern and its environmental determinants require further investigation for most taxa. Using mist‐net data on understorey birds, we evaluated patterns of species richness using two approaches by addressing methodological issues that influence local species richness and the determinants of species richness across Pan‐Amazonia. Specifically, we examined 1) the disparity between observed and expected species richness obtained from geographic range maps; 2) how species eco‐morphological traits influence their detection and relative abundance; 3) the spatial variation in estimated local species richness after controlling for sampling effort; and 4) the environmental determinants of estimated richness. We found no evidence for a longitudinal westward increase in estimated species richness, but there was a marked difference between the northern and southern banks of the Amazon River. Species detection and abundance were modestly explained by species traits, and estimated richness was weakly associated with latitude, aboveground biomass and climatic aridity. We found that observed variation in the local species richness was primarily driven by differences in sampling effort, while estimated species richness showed modest variation across large spatial scales and was poorly explained by environmental and spatial gradients. Despite wide variation in local species richness, we conclude that at broader scales, species richness of understorey bird assemblages was surprisingly stable across Pan‐Amazonia, suggesting that evolutionary processes may be important in determining these patterns at larger scales.",,,0.5,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecog.07625

Dominant species, due to their high abundance, are considered to maintain productivity after species loss. However, it remains unclear whether the community productivity can be maintained or restored by the remaining co‐dominant species after the loss of the dominant species. Therefore, we hypothesized that after the loss of dominant species, the lost productivity would be maintained by the co‐dominant species in the remaining community. This study, conducted over 13 years in an alpine grassland, investigates the compensatory responses of remaining species following the removal of each of two dominant species, Kobresia pygmaea (sedge) and Stipa purpurea (grass), both individually and in combination, under two nitrogen level scenarios. We found that while partial compensation (compensation index &lt; 1) occurred in the remaining community, neither of the remaining dominant species effectively compensated for the loss of the removed species. Leguminous plants showed the most obvious positive response to the removal of dominant species, whereas forbs and sedges showed the most marked negative responses. In addition, fertilization does not promote the recovery of community productivity following removal of the dominant species. Our findings underscore the critical role of dominant species in sustaining productivity. In the face of the accelerating crisis of biodiversity extinction, priority should be given to protecting the dominant species and key functional groups in the region.",,,0.4,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecog.08319

Drake; Cory Merow,"Species distribution models (SDMs) predict where species live or could potentially live and are a key resource for ecological research and conservation decision‐making. However, current SDM methods often perform poorly for rare or inadequately sampled species, which include most species on earth, as well as most of those of the greatest conservation concern. Here, we evaluated the performance of three modeling approaches designed for data‐deficient situations: plug‐and‐play modeling, density‐ratio modeling, and environmental‐range modeling. We compared the performance of algorithms within these approaches with the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model, a widely used density‐ratio algorithm, both for data‐poor species and more generally. We also tested to what extent model cross‐validation performance on training data predicts model performance on independent, presence–absence data. We found that no algorithm performed best in all situations. Across all species, MaxEnt performed best on average but was outperformed by one or more of the plug‐and‐play, density‐ratio, or environmental‐range algorithms in 72% of cases. Six of the other algorithms had the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) distributions not significantly different from MaxEnt's, and for data‐poor species (those with 20 or fewer occurrences), 24 of the algorithms considered had AUC distributions not significantly different from MaxEnt's. However, we found that the algorithm outputs (when thresholded to predict presence vs absence) spanned a wide sensitivity–specificity gradient. Specificity and prediction accuracy assessed on training data were strongly correlated with specificity and prediction accuracy assessed on independent presence–absence data. However, AUC and sensitivity were weakly correlated in training versus testing sets, with only 22% of species having the same model perform best when evaluated on training and independent, presence absence data. Finally, we show how ensembles of algorithms that span the sensitivity–specificity gradient can represent model disagreement in poorly sampled species and improve model predictions.",,,0.5,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecog.08112

Liebhold,"The theory of biotic resistance states that community diversity promotes resistance to biological invasions. This theory has been widely explored for its ability to explain variation in habitat invasibility to non‐native plant species and while the theory holds in some systems, it does not in others. In the case of invasions by herbivorous insects, invasibility could be affected by diversity of plants and/or by diversity of native insects. While only a few studies have explored biotic resistance to insect invasions, limited evidence suggests that plant diversity can actually have a positive effect on invasibility via creation of niches for herbivorous insects though other studies of insect systems indicate that plant diversity has a negative effect on invasibility by diluting the density of hosts. Almost nothing is known about how native insect diversity affects resistance to invasions by other insects. Here we analyzed a unique inventory of native and non‐native Scolytinae/Platypodinae (bark and ambrosia beetles) across the conterminous USA. We assessed the correlates of geographical variation in numbers of both native and non‐native species per 50 × 50 km cell. We find that native tree diversity generally has positive effects on the richness of native beetle species, while the abundance of non‐native hosts promotes richness of non‐native beetles. We also observed that the effect of native beetle diversity on non‐native Scolytinae/Platypodinae species richness is either lacking or positive. These results indicate fundamental differences between plants and insects in the way native and non‐native species interact; while interspecific competition can exert a strong influence on plant invasions, it appears less important for insects. Results thus indicate that the biotic resistance hypothesis does not explain invasion patterns of bark and ambrosia beetles.",,,0.6,,,,,,False,0,10.1002/ecog.08164

Carlson; Ruiwen Hu; Rong‐Xi Tan; Chao Qian; Weigen Huang; Jizhong Zhou; Jingdong Mao; Thomas W. Crowther; Zhi‐Hua Zhou; Jiabao Zhang; Yuting Liang,"ABSTRACT Understanding the apparent temperature dependence of wetland methane emissions ( E M ) is critical for predicting climate‐carbon feedbacks, yet current estimates remain constrained by observational limitations and methodological inconsistencies. The inherent biogeographic heterogeneity of wetland ecosystems combined with sparse, unevenly distributed flux measurements introduces substantial uncertainty in characterizing spatial patterns of E M . This knowledge gap impedes accurate projections of wetland methane contributions under climate warming scenarios. Here, we develop a framework that integrates mixed‐effects models with artificial intelligence techniques to resolve scale‐dependent patterns in methane emission thermodynamics across global wetlands. Our unified framework demonstrates that only 73.6% (5th–95th quantiles: 71.8%–75.4%) of the global wetland area conforms to classical Arrhenius‐type temperature dependence. This framework can predict 69.5% (67.9%–71.1%) of the global wetlands with high confidence using the Mahalanobis distance and area of applicability tests. We quantify the weighted mean E M across high‐confidence predictable areas of 0.694 eV, with latitudinal differentiation: tropical (0.634 eV), temperate (0.678 eV), and boreal (0.745 eV) wetlands exhibit progressively stronger temperature responses. Ignoring these biogeographic variations could result in underestimation of projected end‐century methane emissions by 4.2%–13.3% across selected socioeconomic pathway scenarios. Our study refined the temperature sensitivity parameter in coupled climate‐carbon cycle models, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy of future global warming trends and informing strategic responses to climate change mitigation.",,,0.5,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70748

Additionally, remaining forests experience a range of edge effects through agriculture once it has been established, yet such agriculture‐driven edge effects remain weakly understood. Focusing on the Argentine Dry Chaco, a global hotspot for deforestation, we utilized satellite‐based forest structure indicators within a Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling framework to quantify and map agricultural edge effects on fractional tree and shrub cover, and aboveground biomass. Specifically, we assessed how far edges reach into forests away from the forest‐agriculture interface, whether edge effects differ among post‐deforestation land uses (i.e., cropping vs. ranching), and how edge effects evolve over time. We reveal large agriculture‐driven edge effects in the Chaco, penetrating &gt; 700 m into adjacent forests, with reductions of up to 41% in our structural parameters. Cropping was associated with much stronger edge effects than pastures, likely due to the combined effect of environmental (e.g., wind) and management (e.g., pesticide drift) factors, while silvopastures had much lower edge effects. Projecting our models across the region showed that 18% of remaining forests are degraded, with an estimated total loss of 92.3 million tons of aboveground biomass. Lastly, agriculture‐driven edge effects intensified for long periods after initial deforestation (e.g., &gt; 30 years for tree cover), suggesting agricultural expansion creates a degradation debt that unfolds over decades. We conclude that agriculture‐driven edge effects are a major, yet often overlooked, consequence of agricultural expansion, leading to profound degradation far beyond the deforestation footprint. Despite their importance, these effects remain systematically underestimated in sustainability analyses, such as carbon accounting or biodiversity impact assessments.

Prior studies have focused on the drivers and rates, yet encroacher ecology remains underexplored. We synthesized data across six dominant woody savanna genera ( Combretum, Dichrostachys, Prosopis, Senegalia, Terminalia and Vachellia ) to test whether encroachers represent a non‐random subset of species with life history strategies and functional traits that facilitate establishment and dominance in changing ecosystems. Species were classified as encroachers based on documented ecosystem impacts and compared to non‐encroachers across climatic niches, geographic range size and traits linked to survival in disturbance‐prone ecosystems, including maximum height, plant habit, spinescence and capacity for nitrogen fixation. We identified 63 encroacher species, which occupied broader temperature (11°C–29°C vs. 17°C–27°C) and precipitation (50–2100 mm vs. 444–2300 mm) niches and larger geographic ranges (600,000 km 2 vs. 100,000 km 2 ) than non‐encroachers. Encroachers were generally taller and exhibited plasticity in habit at individual and community scales. Our results suggest that encroachment is driven by ecologically versatile woody species with wide environmental tolerances, large ranges and high phenotypic plasticity. These advantageous attributes may enhance responsiveness to global change factors characteristic of African savannas and grasslands, including altered fire and herbivory regimes, along with rising atmospheric CO 2 .

Purse; Daniel Chapman,"ABSTRACT Tree pests and diseases are a key threat to woodland biodiversity and commercial forestry worldwide. In the UK, the ongoing spread of pests and diseases is severely affecting a range of nationally important tree species, resulting in substantial ecological and economic impacts. As the risk posed by pests and diseases varies across the UK's treescapes, understanding the patterns of risk and the factors underlying these patterns is crucial for designing and implementing effective mitigation strategies. To address this challenge, we modelled the distribution of pests and diseases across mainland Great Britain, focusing on the total pest and disease burdens for nine host tree species of particular ecological, economic and cultural importance. Using integrated species distribution models, we combined two datasets—totalling 18,871 pest and disease records across 22 years—to model the spatial patterns of risk. To examine the factors underlying these distributions, we used graph‐based causal inference approaches to inform our model design and to explore the robustness of our conclusions to variations in our modelling assumptions. We found that pest and disease burdens for broadleaved host trees exhibited hotspots in England, while burdens for conifer hosts tended to be high in Scotland. We identified urban area, human population density and local recreation as important drivers for several species, mainly native broadleaves. By contrast, woodland connectivity, afforestation and the level of conifer coverage were the most important drivers of pest and disease burdens for conifer hosts. Deforestation was also an important driver, with effects on pest and disease burdens for both conifers and broadleaves. Our findings have implications for the management of the UK's treescapes in the face of continuing threats from tree pests and diseases, including supporting targeted surveillance and the prioritisation of tree species for future planting.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70706

Post‐disturbance recovery is crucial for forest resilience and the continued provision of ecosystem services. We surveyed 849 plots in disturbance hotspots across 10 Central European countries to assess the state of early (3–5 years) post‐disturbance tree regeneration. Our specific objectives were to quantify post‐disturbance tree recovery, identify key drivers, and assess future trajectories using model‐based analyses. We found robust tree recovery throughout Central Europe, with median stem densities of 4750 n ha −1 . Only 7% of plots had no regeneration. Regeneration density increased with precipitation, particularly at warm sites, and decreased with disturbance severity and size. The most frequently regenerating tree species was Picea abies (present on 48% of plots), a species that is poorly adapted to future heat and drought. Overall, we found that 75% of the currently established trees are projected to be outside of their climatic niche by the end of the century under moderate climate change (RCP4.5).

In particular, the role of fine‐scale canopy microclimate in shaping photosynthetic temperature responses in tropical trees has been overlooked. We quantified vertical microclimate variation and measured leaf‐level photosynthetic temperature responses in 13 coexisting evergreen tree species spanning the full canopy profile in a lowland Congo Basin forest. Leaf gas exchange measurements were integrated with structural leaf traits and high‐resolution microclimate profiles to assess how temperature conditions and ecological strategies shape photosynthetic responses. Photosynthetic traits, including the light‐saturated photosynthetic rate at the temperature optimum and stomatal conductance at the temperature optimum, increased with canopy height, with pioneer species showing steeper increases than non‐pioneers. The temperature optimum of photosynthesis ( T opt ) was positively related to both mean and maximum leaf temperature ( T leaf ), driven mainly by interspecific differences rather than intraspecific plasticity. This suggests that T opt reflects species‐level adaptation to the temperature conditions of their canopy niche rather than leaf‐level adjustment to local microclimate. Stomatal conductance influenced T leaf via transpiration and thereby contributed to shaping T opt . Leaves experiencing larger temperature fluctuations showed reduced sensitivity, reflected in a broader photosynthetic temperature‐response width ( Ω ). Ω was also positively associated with structural traits such as leaf mass per area and leaf dry matter content, both within and among species, indicating that greater structural investment helps sustain higher photosynthetic rates across wider temperature ranges and enhances tolerance to temperature variability. By linking canopy microclimate, physiological traits, and structural characteristics, our findings demonstrate how vertical microclimatic gradients and functional diversity jointly determine photosynthetic temperature responses in tropical forest trees. Incorporating leaf‐level temperature regimes, stomatal regulation, and trait variation into vegetation models could improve predictions of tropical forest carbon dynamics under climate change.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70733

Stegen; Jianjun Wang,"ABSTRACT Fluxes of organic matter across Earth habitats shape ecosystem function and carbon storage. Yet, it is challenging to predict how the molecules are preferentially accumulated in specific habitats, that is, the habitat affinities, due to their diverse characteristics. Here, we develop an indicator of compositional‐level habitat affinity for dissolved organic matter (DOM) by quantifying the aggregated affinities of individual molecules that are over‐ or under‐represented relative to a reference habitat. Applying this indicator to 93 paired riverine water‐sediment sites, we find that 65.1% of molecules show non‐significant habitat affinities for water or sediment and are thermodynamically favorable and susceptible to microbial degradation. Consistently, the habitat affinities of DOM assemblages decrease with lower molecular weights and recalcitrance for waters, and with higher thermodynamic favorability for sediments. These affinities are both reduced by elevated temperatures and anthropogenic pressures, such as nitrogen loading and land‐use change. Our projection of habitat affinities of global riverine DOM shows that regions with intense anthropogenic disturbances or warm climates, such as East Asia, Western Europe, and the Amazon, tend to exhibit lower affinities. These findings suggest enhanced molecular homogenization between water and sediment habitats is associated with environmental changes and underscore the importance of habitat affinities for predicting the potential trajectories of organic carbon across ecosystems.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70736

Wilson Fernandes; Yadvinder Malhi; Jesús Aguirre‐Gutiérrez,"ABSTRACT The Amazon Forest is undergoing rapid ecological shifts driven by intensifying drought, rising temperatures, and widespread anthropogenic disturbance. Yet the reorganization of vegetation functional strategies under climate stress remains poorly quantified at the biome scale. Here, we show that the temporal stability of canopy reflectance offers a sensitive remote proxy for sclerophylly—leaf toughness, a key indicator of conservative, drought‐adaptive plant strategies. By integrating ground‐based trait data (specific leaf area, SLA) from over 3000 trees across 448 plots in the Amazon‐Cerrado savanna transition zone with high‐resolution remote sensing imagery, we demonstrate that lower SLA—a well‐established proxy for conservative leaf strategies—is associated with reduced dry‐season variability in the blue band spectral reflectance of vegetation. Extending the analysis across 130 plots in nine Amazonian countries using 40 years of harmonised remote sensing data, we find that dry‐season reflectance variability has declined by ~34% (a drop of ~10 percentage points) since 1984, indicating a biome‐wide shift toward greater drought tolerance. This trend is most pronounced in the southern and eastern Amazon and closely tracks rising climate stress, particularly increased temperature, evaporative demand, and water deficit. If these patterns persist, much of the southern and eastern Amazon could reach reflectance‐stability levels comparable to transitional zones with the Cerrado savanna biome within the next three to four decades. Our results show signals of an early‐stage forest functional transformation that could reduce forest productivity and carbon uptake, increase vulnerability to fire, and diminish biodiversity.

We evaluated maize yields under different scenarios of soil fertility (using soil organic carbon as a proxy) and climate change (considering changes in temperature, rainfall, and CO 2 ) at four sites in SSA. Using an ensemble of 15 calibrated soil‐crop models, we found a strong consensus that, without fertilization, soil fertility declines over time, impacting maize yields more strongly than changes in temperature, rainfall, or CO 2 . The model ensemble indicated that when accounting for soil fertility changes, the yield benefits of combined application of organic and mineral inputs increase over time, even under climate change.

Moura,"ABSTRACT Tropospheric ozone (O 3 ) is a pervasive stressor that impairs forest biomass and alters carbon allocation strategies. This study assessed biomass responses across 17 woody taxa under free‐air controlled exposure (FACE), integrating a decade of experiments conducted with an analogous exposure regime applied to deciduous and evergreen species. The analysis provided a comparative evaluation of existing flux‐based metrics. Statistical analyses revealed consistent reductions in relative total (RTB), aboveground (RTAB), and belowground (RTBB) biomass with increasing O 3 uptake in terms of phytotoxic ozone dose (POD 1 mmol m −2 ). Deciduous species reached the 4% biomass reduction threshold (CL 4 ) at lower POD 1 levels for RTBB (10.21), RTAB (13.16), and RTB (10.77) and displayed relatively small values for RTBB (2.75), RTAB (5.70), and RTB (3.31), where represents the increment in O 3 uptake required to reach the CL 4 threshold. In contrast, evergreen species showed higher CL 4 for RTBB (11.48), RTAB (15.40), and RTB (13.86) and larger values for RTBB (8.40), RTAB (12.32), and RTB (10.78), reflecting a slower biomass decline. Contrasting relationships suggest that leaf habit‐specific patterns are associated with divergent carbon allocation strategies under O 3 stress. In deciduous species, POD 1 and Leaf Index Flux (LIF) were negatively correlated with shoot‐to‐root ratio (S/R), whereas in evergreen species, both indices were positively correlated with leaf area ratio (LAR) and S/R. In conclusion, flux‐based metrics provided a biologically robust framework for quantifying O 3 ‐induced biomass losses, revealing higher sensitivity in deciduous species than in evergreens and highlighting the root as the most vulnerable compartment under O 3 exposure. The findings should be interpreted considering the spatial and temporal constraints of a single‐site FACE experiment and the focus on O 3 as a stand‐alone stressor without interaction effects. Future research should combine O 3 uptake with multi‐stressor frameworks to better predict biomass and carbon responses in complex field conditions.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70728

Benthic organisms, vital to these ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Rising temperatures, ocean acidification, and shifting currents disrupt benthic species and communities, yet future related impact assessments remain limited. Here, we trained species distribution models with predictors from state of the art physical and biogeochemical marine models and a large database of species records (&gt; 100,000 occurrences) to project the current and future distributions of ~350 benthic species (excluding cephalopods, invasive species, and commercially exploited species) and their related changes per site in diversity (α‐) and community composition (β‐diversity) over the Mediterranean Sea. We predicted most species to shift their distribution northwards for all future scenarios due to changes in water temperature and dissolved oxygen close to the seafloor, with up to 60% of species experiencing range contraction, 77% moving northwards, 20% experiencing range fragmentation (measured as range disjunctions in models' output), and 30% moving toward deeper waters over time. Cold‐adapted species were more likely to face range contraction and shifts towards deeper waters, while warm‐adapted species were more likely to face range expansions and shifts towards shallower waters. α‐diversity increased in the Northern and decreased in the Southern Mediterranean, respectively. Changes in β‐diversity within sites highlighted compositional changes (species turnover) in communities located in the Aegean and Tyrrhenian Seas, in deep parts of the Ionian Sea, and in coastal regions of the Adriatic Sea. Climate‐smart, ecosystem‐based Marine Spatial Planning can capitalize on the identified hotspots of species losses, gains, stability, and turnover. Prioritizing connectivity in regions of strong turnover and extending protected areas in regions with stable α‐diversity and limited turnover is recommended for improved conservation actions.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70725

Our bibliometric analysis of over 580,000 records shows that ~80% of author affiliations come from Global North institutions, meaning that research agendas, theoretical frameworks, and priorities are still largely shaped outside the regions with the highest biodiversity and greatest vulnerability to climate change. This imbalance reflects structural and historical inequalities that limit the ability of Global South countries to conduct autonomous research and sustain long‐term monitoring. When research and funding originate abroad, local scientists are often excluded, leading to the loss of traditional knowledge, regional perspectives, and long‐term capacity building. These dynamics leave tropical and subtropical bioregions (generally in the Global South) underrepresented in global climate knowledge. To address this imbalance, we propose six actions: invest in infrastructure and monitoring, strengthen local research networks, link funding to capacity building, promote open and equitable data access, connect science with regional policies, and foster intersectoral collaboration. We argue that truly effective climate change biology must be global, equitable, and diverse.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70711
894,Potential Trade‐Off Between Temperature and Tissue Loss Resistance in Corals Associating With Algal Symbionts in the Genus <i>Durusdinium</i>,,,,,0.0,Global Change Biology,A,applied_ecology,Wing Yan Chan; Talisa Doering; Luka Meyers; Justin Maire; Cecilie R. Gøtze; Rumi Sakamoto; Madeleine J. H. van Oppen,"ABSTRACT The symbioses between corals and microorganisms, including the endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (family Symbiodiniaceae) and bacteria, are central to coral health and functioning. Certain species of Symbiodiniaceae in the genus Durusdinium are known to confer enhanced thermotolerance to corals and could therefore be beneficial under global climate change. However, association with thermotolerant algal symbionts may come with trade‐offs that affect long‐term coral persistence, and this study reports on one potentially consequential trade‐off. We exposed colonies of the coral Galaxea fascicularis hosting Symbiodiniaceae in the genus Cladocopium (C‐corals) or Durusdinium (D‐corals) to elevated temperature equivalent to ~9.5 degree heating weeks. While C‐corals were heat‐sensitive, as evidenced by reduced Symbiodiniaceae cell density, photochemical efficiency and tissue pigmentation, they were resilient to tissue loss, maintained a stable bacterial community under elevated temperature, and showed limited mortality (12.5%) at the end of the 15‐week recovery. Conversely, D‐corals showed limited Symbiodiniaceae photodamage or tissue pigmentation loss under elevated temperature and initially demonstrated heat resilience. However, D‐corals exhibited tissue loss and a significant reduction in newly formed polyps under elevated temperature, which occurred in parallel with a shift in their bacterial community composition toward taxa linked to bleaching, disease or algal overgrowth (e.g., Sphingomonas ). Most D‐corals died at the end of the recovery period. The intracellular bacterial communities in Cladocopium and Durusdinium freshly isolated from the experimental corals revealed symbiont‐specific patterns, where Durusdinium showed strong affiliation with the diazotroph Ruegeria sp. Our findings show that G. fascicularis associating with the thermally tolerant Durusdinium may have higher susceptibility to tissue loss relative to corals with Cladocopium symbionts. If this trade‐off occurs across corals that can associate with both Cladocopium and Durusdinium , it can have profound implications for reef persistence under global climate change, and further study is critical to inform conservation strategies aiming to build resilient reefs.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70641

Mills; Jacob B. Socolar; Jose M. Ochoa Quintero; Robert P. Freckleton; Torbjørn Haugaasen; James J. Gilroy; David P. Edwards,"ABSTRACT Forest conversion for agriculture is a major cause of tropical biodiversity loss, but its impacts vary with spatial scale. Higher species turnover in forests than in farmland means that land‐use change causes greater biodiversity loss at broader than at local scales, yet broad‐scale assessments are scarce. Phylogenetic diversity is increasingly prioritised in conservation to protect evolutionary history under global change, yet how deforestation‐driven changes in phylogenetic diversity scale spatially and accumulate in regions of high species turnover remains unclear. We compiled a large field database from across 13 biogeographically diverse regions affected by deforestation for cattle farming, covering most of Colombia, a megadiverse tropical country. Using occupancy models, we estimated bird communities for 1547 (936 observed plus 611 never‐observed) species across ecoregions and nationally in both forest and pasture habitats to quantify changes in phylogenetic diversity metrics and determine whether these impacts are dependent on spatial scale. We found an average loss of 2300 Myr of phylogenetic diversity at the country scale, with most species negatively affected across the phylogeny. Although single regional‐scale relative loss was on average comparable to broader scales, there was high variability between regional units. The latter was especially critical when evaluating metrics of evolutionary distinctiveness, which are key indicators for biodiversity conservation planning. Such underestimation of national‐scale impacts highlights the importance of sampling across multiple regions. Immediate conservation action is needed to safeguard evolutionarily unique species and prevent phylogenetic homogenisation driven by agricultural expansion across spatial scales—a threat often underestimated due to assessments limited to single biogeographic regions.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70702

Here, we developed an explainable LSTM‐Attention framework that integrates LSTM networks, attention mechanisms, and gradient‐based attribution methods to reveal temporal dependencies in ecosystem carbon flux responses by analyzing eddy covariance flux measurements from 71 sites spanning eight North American biomes. Using this approach, we identified three distinct temporal memory patterns governing carbon flux responses. Grasslands exhibit short‐term memory dominance with exponentially increasing temporal contributions from distant to recent past. Deciduous broadleaf forests and wetlands show long‐term memory dominance, with deciduous broadleaf forests displaying the strongest historical dependence (attribution values declining from 0.30 at 6 months to 0.045 at 1 month). Croplands and evergreen needleleaf forests demonstrate U‐shaped dual memory patterns. Building on these temporal patterns, we identified biome‐specific environmental drivers operating within each memory framework: wetlands primarily controlled by soil moisture, evergreen needleleaf forests by radiation, and closed shrublands by vapor pressure deficit. Beyond individual drivers, we uncovered critical nonlinear interactions that diverged from linear correlations at most sites (55 of 71 with ρ &lt; 0.5). For instance, the carbon sink capacity of deciduous broadleaf forests depends on synchronized canopy development and photosynthetic activity, while closed shrublands show strong suppression of carbon uptake by atmospheric water deficit regardless of vegetation greenness, revealing how multiple drivers jointly regulate ecosystem functioning. Validating memory's fundamental role, ablation experiments confirmed that removing memory mechanisms degraded model prediction performance and altered environmental driver identification (Kendall's Tau &lt; 0.5), demonstrating that temporal memory is integral to accurately modeling ecosystem carbon flux responses to environmental drivers. These findings provide mechanistic insights into temporal controls of carbon exchange across different biomes.

Here, we synthesize data from 184 sites across 23 countries to quantify their carbon stocks, carbon accumulation rate (CAR) and greenhouse gas (GHG, CO 2 and CH 4 ) emissions. Our results reveal that tidal flats sequester 8.6 (4.5–9.9) Tg C yr −1 and store 1.2 (0.7–2.0) Pg C in the top meter of sediments, increasing global blue carbon estimates by 6%–17%. However, they simultaneously emit 0.073 Tg CH 4 yr −1 (3.3 Tg CO 2 eq yr −1 ), 27.9% of the CH 4 emissions from salt marshes, offsetting 14.1% (1.8%–20.4%) of their carbon sequestration benefits. Mudflats exhibit the highest carbon stocks and CO 2 fluxes among different sediment types, primarily due to their abundant binding sites of fine‐grained particles and stronger microbial activities. Both CAR and CH 4 fluxes decline poleward, with tropical zone as hotspots. Our findings highlight the urgency of integrating tidal flats into climate mitigation strategies, particularly given their vulnerability to land‐use changes and sea‐level rise.

Yet their responses to global change stressors remain poorly understood, with most evidence derived from local‐scale experiments. Here, we conducted a meta‐analysis synthesizing 657 observations from 48 publications conducted at 38 sites to assess how structural traits (cover, species richness, and moss biomass) and a key functional trait (chlorophyll content) of biocrusts respond to warming, altered precipitation, nitrogen addition, and their interactions. We found that nitrogen addition produced the strongest overall decline in biocrust cover (−52%). Warming (−21%) also significantly reduced biocrust cover, and its combined effect with decreased precipitation caused greater losses (−44%). Species richness declined under combined warming and decreased precipitation (−8%). Chlorophyll content responded negatively to decreased precipitation (−26%), combined warming and decreased precipitation (−35%), and nitrogen addition (−21%), but increased under elevated precipitation (+55%). Moss biomass exhibited weak and inconsistent responses to nitrogen addition. The response of biocrusts varied among dominant biocrust types, ecosystems, and climate zones. Late‐successional crusts (moss‐ and lichen‐dominated) exhibited the strongest declines, whereas cyanobacterial crusts often persisted or even expanded under stress. Biocrusts in semi‐arid grasslands were most negatively affected by warming and reduced precipitation, whereas those in humid tundra and forests were most sensitive to nitrogen addition. In addition, biocrust responses were shaped by the characteristics of global change manipulations, with warming and precipitation reduction being more sensitive to duration than magnitude, whereas nitrogen addition rate exerted stronger effects than duration. Together, these findings demonstrate that biocrusts are highly vulnerable to global change, potentially undermining their capacity to control erosion and regulate carbon and nutrient cycling. We emphasize the urgent need to safeguard biocrusts in a rapidly changing world.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70723

Bowler; Marie Anne Eurie Forio; Peter Goethals; Ioannis Karaouzas; Ariane Moulinec; James S. Sinclair; Rudy Vannevel; Peter Haase; Ellen A. R. Welti,"ABSTRACT Biodiversity loss can lead to biotic homogenization, whereby local communities within a region become increasingly similar over time, resulting in simplified communities with reduced functionality. However, our understanding of whether alleviating anthropogenic stress can reverse homogenization and promote biotic differentiation (i.e., increasing dissimilarity) remains limited, partly because the effectiveness of conservation actions is often assessed only at the local scale (e.g., increases in local diversity). Here, we examined evidence for biotic differentiation in European river invertebrate communities, a system that has generally shown signs of local recovery. We analyzed 447 time series of river invertebrate communities from 1994 to 2023, spanning 48 river basins across 15 European countries. We then related trends in community similarity within each basin, measured as taxonomic and trait β‐diversity, to spatial gradients of anthropogenic stress, including ecological quality (a proxy of general anthropogenic stress), air temperature increase, and land cover pressure. β‐diversity trends were strongly mediated by anthropogenic stress levels, with communities in lower‐stress basins showing differentiation, while those in higher‐stress basins homogenized. In addition, we found that the direction of β‐diversity change depended less on taxa or traits being gained or lost, and more on the identity of the traits involved, highlighting how trait composition mediates community responses to anthropogenic change. Specifically, additions promoted differentiation at lower stress levels but contributed to homogenization under conditions of higher stress, whereas subtractions exhibited the inverse pattern. Our results demonstrate that β‐diversity responds asymmetrically to spatial variation in anthropogenic stress, with both homogenization and differentiation occurring within a system that is, overall, undergoing recovery. Recognizing the stress‐dependent responses of β‐diversity allows researchers and managers to more accurately assess conservation success and provide recommendations that promote long‐term ecosystem structural and functional recovery.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70716

However, soil microorganisms are also highly sensitive to on‐going global change, and the influence of an increasing number of stressors on common, rare, and unknown taxa across large environmental gradients remains virtually unknown. Here, we combined a large‐scale spatial field survey across multiple different ecosystems and found that the diversity and abundance of soil rare taxa were significantly reduced under high environmental stressor number (i.e., a high number of stressors passing a 75% stressor threshold). Strikingly, the abundance of unknown soil taxa and unknown genes increased with increasing environmental stress number. We further identified the metagenome‐assembled genomes (MAGs) that were considered as relatively common taxa using metagenomics. Compared to 9% of negative responders, 32% of common MAGs were resistant or positively responsive to multiple stress, displaying a reduced potential for cellular processes and an enhanced potential for environmental, genetic, and metabolic processes.

Ordway,"ABSTRACT The Congo Basin and its contiguous forests harbor globally significant carbon stocks, estimated at 65 gigatons of C (GtC) above and belowground. Despite rising temperatures and intensifying droughts, they have remained a carbon sink, albeit weak: 0.26–0.50 GtC yr. −1 carbon uptake since 1980. However, these forests' carbon stocks and fluxes, including gross primary productivity, respiration, net primary productivity, and riverine carbon transport, remain poorly quantified. This limits understanding of the region's role in the global carbon cycle, its vulnerability to environmental change, and its potential as a long‐term carbon sink. We review and quantify Congo Basin and contiguous forest carbon stocks and fluxes and synthesize the current knowledge on how key global change drivers shape the region's carbon cycle. We find limited responses to long‐term precipitation variability, but declining stocks and fluxes in response to long‐term and increasing temperature and drought frequency. Land cover and land use changes, largely driven by small‐scale agriculture, logging, and agro‐industrial expansion, reduce carbon stocks, ecosystem structure and functioning, and animal‐mediated ecosystem services. In contrast, large‐scale savanna biomass burning delivers phosphorus and nitrogen to Congo Basin forests via cross‐equatorial winds, providing additional nutrients and supporting carbon sequestration. In situ studies suggest that CO 2 fertilization has increased intrinsic water‐use efficiency, although its effects may be modulated by climate change, and its impacts on biomass accumulation remain uncertain. Legacy effects from historical land use and climate change likely shaped present‐day vegetation structure, yet their relative influence is unclear. High‐resolution carbon monitoring, improved remote sensing, and strengthened in situ measurement networks are needed to quantify the impacts of these key drivers and their interactions on the Central African carbon cycle. This is needed to inform conservation strategies and advance understanding of the region's future as a carbon sink under global change pressures.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70688

Climate‐driven warming and excessive nutrient inputs are key drivers of HABs in global lakes. However, as nutrient reduction strategies gain traction, the relative contributions of rising water temperatures and nutrient enrichment remain unclear. Here, we compiled a dataset spanning 40 years from 156 lakes worldwide and analyzed the nonlinear response relationship between chlorophyll‐ a (Chl‐ a ) and water temperature using a combination of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and a random forest (RF) model. EMD demonstrated strong adaptability in extracting long‐term stable signals from non‐stationary records, revealing that over 40% of the lakes are eutrophic, with substantial spatial heterogeneity in HAB intensity; mean Chl‐ a concentrations reached as high as 26 μg L −1 in tropical regions. As warming continues, water temperature emerges as a progressively stronger driver of HABs, surpassing the influences of nutrient availability and stoichiometric balance. Rising water temperatures diminish the reliance of HABs on nutrient availability, while the nitrogen‐to‐phosphorus ratio consistently explains variation in Chl‐ a concentrations throughout the warming process. Furthermore, RF‐based scenario projections indicate that under current warming and nutrient scenarios, the mean annual Chl‐ a concentrations of global lakes are projected to rise to 17.7 μg L −1 under RCP 4.5 and 18.4 μg L −1 under RCP 8.5 by the end of the 21st century.

Goodyear; Deanna H. Olson; Kathryn L. Ronnenberg; Jaime Bosch; Daniel Pincheira‐Donoso,"ABSTRACT Global amphibian declines outpace the loss of most organisms on Earth. The panzootic fungal disease chytridiomycosis, caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ( Bd ), is widely regarded as a predominant driver behind amphibian biodiversity erosion. However, a comprehensive global‐scale analysis of the relationship between Bd and extinction risk remains lacking. Using a global database of Bd ‐detections and IUCN Red List extinction risk, we show that current amphibian declines are associated with Bd in temperate regions only, whereas historical analyses reveal a past peak of Bd ‐related declines across more equatorial areas during 1980–2004, that has diminished in intensity in recent decades (2004–2020). In contrast, temperate species show a lack of Bd ‐related declines during 1980–2004 but significant declines are currently ongoing. We suggest that the shorter activity seasons in temperate regions may have acted as ‘natural lockdowns’ that delayed the annihilating effects of Bd in susceptible species. Conversely, year‐round activity in more amphibian‐dense, equatorial areas may have triggered a faster transition into post‐epizootic dynamics, characterised by a continuous high‐intensity outbreak followed by amphibian population stabilisation and pathogen persistence at lower levels.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70712

However, accurate quantification of soil respiration ( R s )—the primary CO 2 efflux from forests—remains challenging due to existing studies' overreliance on annual‐scale estimates, which obscure fine‐scale spatiotemporal dynamics and key drivers of R s . Here, we developed a 500 m resolution monthly R s dataset for China's forests (2000–2020) using remote sensing data and a geographically weighted machine learning model. A geographically weighted extreme gradient boosting model achieved the highest accuracy in predicting monthly R s ( R 2 = 0.74, RMSE = 0.8 g C m −2 day −1 ). The mean total annual R s from 2000 to 2020 was 2.32 ± 0.09 Pg C year −1 , with summer contributing most and winter least. Annual total R s and seasonal total R s showed significant increasing trends across China's forests from 2000 to 2020, with the strongest increases in southern China's young/middle‐aged natural management forests and plantations. The relationships between R s and its driving factors varied: gross primary productivity (GPP) was the primary driver of annual R s across all forest management and age classes. Seasonally, temperature dominated R s in spring/winter, and GPP dominated summer R s across all forest management and age classes, while precipitation effects varied with management/age classes and season.

Burke; William K. Lauenroth,"ABSTRACT Extreme heat and drought are becoming more frequent, altering the distribution and disturbance cycles of plant communities. These weather events have caused widespread mortality of woody plant species globally. We investigated the environmental conditions preceding multiple shrub mortality events in a widespread North American dryland (big sagebrush ecosystems) using field and remote sensing data, a process‐based ecosystem water balance model, and historic weather data. We identified temperature and soil water conditions that were similar across sites preceding a mortality event. We used historic and future climate data with an ecosystem water balance model to investigate how the probabilities of these events have and will change relative to historic (1915–1980) frequencies under current conditions and future emissions scenarios. Our analysis showed that the frequency of these events is likely to increase and, in many areas, has already surpassed historical conditions. Last, we used 898 sites spread across big sagebrush ecosystems to understand the spatial variability of this increase in frequency of mortality‐related conditions. While the frequency of extreme hot and dry conditions is projected to increase, there is substantial variability across the region. Our findings highlight substantial risks of weather‐related mortality in regions previously projected to be relatively stable under climate change, suggesting that extreme events may represent an underappreciated dimension in modeling efforts.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70703

Bueno de Mesquita; Corey R. Lawrence; Philip D. Weyman; Daniel Dores; Tania Timmermann; Noah Fierer; Gonzalo A. Fuenzalida‐Meriz,"ABSTRACT Over geologic timescales, the natural weathering of silicate minerals in soils and regolith regulates atmospheric CO 2 . Although this process is slow relative to anthropogenic emissions, several strategies have been proposed to accelerate this process for climate mitigation. These include the application of finely‐ground silicate rock to increase mineral surface area (enhanced weathering, EW) and the use of microbes that catalyze mineral dissolution and CO 2 biomineralization (microbial carbon dioxide mineralization, MCM). While both approaches show promise, their combined application has rarely been tested. Here, we examined how soil chemistry and bacterial communities respond to a basalt feedstock rich in silicate minerals, a Bacillus subtilis strain (MP1) previously shown to enhance weathering, and their combination. In a 91‐day soybean mesocosm experiment with slightly acidic soil (pH 6.6), MP1 persisted where applied, indicating successful inoculation via seed treatment. Basalt amendments had the strongest effect on soil bacterial community composition, whereas inoculation with MP1 exerted a smaller but detectable influence. Biogeochemical indices of weathering indicated that co‐application of basalt and MP1 enhanced carbonate alkalinity beyond basalt alone. Soil carbonate alkalinity increased with MP1 treatment both with and without basalt, while soil pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC) increased with basalt in both MP1 and non‐MP1 treatments. Total carbon was highest in the combined MP1 + basalt treatment, suggesting that MP1 may mitigate short‐term organic carbon losses associated with basalt‐driven priming. Overall, these results provide new insights into interactions between biological and mineral‐based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies, suggesting that co‐application of MP1 with basalt in slightly acidic soil may enhance carbonate alkalinity while reducing organic carbon losses relative to basalt alone. Thus, pairing B. subtilis MP1 with enhanced weathering deployments emerges as a promising strategy to improve CDR efficiency.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70705

The impacts of GCFs on GHG emissions were largely explained by climate, biome types, and GCF‐induced changes in soil moisture, providing potential tools for managing global change. Our work provides critical insights, emphasizing that the number of global change stressors needs to be immediately reduced to help minimize the negative impacts of carbon greenhouse gas emissions on climate change.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70633

Using &gt; 370,000 observations from over four decades of spring ichthyoplankton surveys in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea, we investigated long‐term changes in the phenology of 29 fish species, including commercially important taxa such as Pacific cod, walleye pollock, and Pacific halibut. Larval size on a standardized date (size‐at‐date) was used as a proxy for larval developmental timing in spring, and reflects a combination of hatch timing (larval age), growth, and mortality. Spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed models were used to account for variable sampling effort in space and time in order to isolate long‐term trends and thermal effects on larval size. For a majority of species, interannual variation in mean size‐at‐date was significantly and positively related to temperature, demonstrating widespread thermal effects on the phenology of fish early life stages. Despite the wide diversity of life history traits exhibited by the 29 species examined, patterns in size‐at‐date over time were similar across most species within each ecosystem, reflecting the common effect of temperature on phenology. While temperature affected size‐at‐date, there was little evidence of long‐term trends, likely due to the lack of a linear trend in winter–spring temperatures observed in recent decades. We demonstrate a novel analytical method to assess changes in phenology from larval size observations sampled at variable locations and times, and detect phenological shifts that were not necessarily identifiable from larval abundance data alone. Our results suggest that earlier spring phenology due to warming will be a common response among fishes to projected future climate change in high‐latitude ecosystems.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70708

Zimmerman; Michael Keller; María Uriarte; Xiangtao Xu,"ABSTRACT Hurricanes strongly regulate vegetation structure and dynamics in coastal tropical forests by causing tree mortality and damaging the crowns of surviving trees. Despite the importance of this damage for long‐term forest demography and carbon dynamics, the patterns and drivers of variation in hurricane‐induced damage across heterogeneous landscapes remain poorly quantified. Here, we integrate field inventory data with repeated airborne LiDAR measurements to quantify tree crown damage following Hurricane María (Category 4) in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. We applied two approaches: manually delineated crowns and an automatic 3D crown delineation algorithm (AMS3D) to quantify individual crown damage from Hurricane Maria over the 16‐ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP). Both methods consistently revealed that taller canopies experienced less damage compared with shorter canopy trees, contradicting previous pixel‐based remote sensing assessments reporting greater damage in taller trees and forests. Analysis of crown‐level responses to hurricanes showed that tall canopy trees (≥ 25 m) suffered approximately 30% less crown area damage than shorter canopy trees (~15 m), while other tree‐level factors had negligible effects. At the stand level, canopy height was also negatively associated with damage. Quadrats dominated by Prestoea acuminata var montana and Dacryodes excelsa experienced less damage. The effect of stand canopy rugosity and topography was limited. Across the landscape, canopies at low elevations experienced higher damage, possibly due to shifts in species composition along the elevation gradient. As climate change is expected to increase hurricane frequency and intensity in the North Atlantic, our findings highlight the need for incorporating organismal attributes (tree size and species identity) into process‐based ecosystem models to accurately predict hurricane‐induced damage. Furthermore, moving from pixel‐based to crown‐based remote sensing approaches is essential to correctly capture forest responses and reduce prediction biases in tropical forest vulnerability and resilience under intensifying storm regimes.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70709
914,Reversibility of Interannual Tree Growth Variability in Southern Boreal Forest,,,,,0.0,Global Change Biology,A,applied_ecology,Yang Tang; Enzai Du; Baolin Xue; Josep Peñuelas; Peter B. Reich,"ABSTRACT The southern boreal forest has experienced a profound shift in growth pattern because of climate change. However, it remains underexplored whether climate variation has increased interannual tree growth variability and if this trend is reversible under climate warming. On the basis of a field investigation and dendrochronological analysis, we evaluated the temporal changes in interannual tree growth variability across a temperate‐boreal forest ecotone in northeastern China. Our results indicate that the interannual growth variability of Dahurian larch ( Larix gmelinii ), the dominant boreal tree species, increased significantly (0.005 year −1 ) during a rapid warming period (1980–2006), whereas the annual growth rate, measured by standardized basal area increment, declined significantly. This increase in growth variability was mainly explained by an increase in the interannual variability of moisture during both mid‐growing season and the non‐growing season, and interannual variability of temperature during the growing season. During the subsequent period (2007–2018), the interannual growth variability decreased rapidly (−0.04 year −1 ) to the level in the early 1980s, whereas the annual growth rate exhibited no significant trend. The decrease in growth variability was largely attributable to a reduced interannual variability in growing season temperature and increased mean temperature during the non‐growing season. Moreover, the rate of decline in growth variability was higher near the boreal forest, and the spatial variation was primarily regulated by tree height and the rate of change in the mean temperature of the growing season's starting month. Our findings suggest that the trend and level of interannual tree growth variability in the southern boreal forest remain reversible under near‐term climate warming. This result provides a more nuanced perspective compared to the assumption of irreversible shifts in tree growth stability in southern boreal forest because of climate warming.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70696

Until now, most research has focused on the impacts of extreme temperature events. However, in many ecosystems, it is becoming increasingly apparent that climate change is accelerating the onset of spring warming conditions. These advanced warming conditions can significantly disrupt critical biological processes such as reproduction, which is key for population persistence. While interest in phenological shifts has increased in recent years, their effects on marine foundation species, such as corals, remain poorly understood. Here, we combined observational and experimental approaches to assess the effects of advanced spring warming conditions driven by climate change on the reproduction of the Mediterranean octocoral Paramuricea clavata , a foundation species. Our findings reveal that a 2°C warming leads to a 2‐week advancement in P. clavata spawning, as evidenced by both field observations, and ex‐situ experiments. These results underscore the role of advanced spring warming as a significant driver of phenological shifts in coastal marine ecosystems. Furthermore, we show that this phenological shift lead to a reduction in the number of spawning events, as well as decreases in larval biomass, survival rates, and settlement success. These findings highlight the urgent necessity to monitor phenological changes in foundational marine species, as such shifts can undermine the long‐term viability of coral populations and contribute to substantial decline in associated biodiversity. Consequently, the increased vulnerability of species caused by phenological responses driven by seasonal changes may lead to more dramatic consequences of ocean warming than previously anticipated.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70660

Such co‐invasions can generate non‐additive impacts on ecosystems, either exacerbating or mitigating invasion outcomes, yet their ecological consequences and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We conducted a two‐phase greenhouse experiment using Solidago canadensis as a focal invader and 16 co‐occurring invaders to condition soils in monocultures and mixtures, and then tested effects of these soils on a native plant community. We found that non‐additive effects of co‐invasions on native community biomass were generally negative, with phylogenetically distant co‐invaders exerting stronger negative effects. These patterns were largely driven by synergistic increases in the richness of putative soil fungal pathogens induced by distantly related co‐invaders. A complementary field survey confirmed these patterns in natural communities, showing that greater phylogenetic distance among co‐invaders was associated with higher richness of putative soil fungal pathogens and stronger reductions in native plant abundance. Our study provides the first empirical evidence that evolutionary relatedness among co‐invaders predicts the direction and magnitude of their combined impacts via soil microbial pathways. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating evolutionary and belowground mechanisms into invasion theory, and underscore the urgent need to recognize co‐invasion as a key process for predicting and managing invasion impacts under global change.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70710
917,Phase‐Asymmetric Thermal Sensitivity Amplifies Respiration Hysteresis in Heatwaves,,,,,0.0,Global Change Biology,A,applied_ecology,Jiaye Ping; Jianyang Xia; Shuli Niu; Yiqi Luo,"ABSTRACT Understanding how extreme climate events reshape the temperature response of ecosystem respiration (Re) is critical for predicting carbon–climate feedbacks. Here, we combine observational data and land surface model simulations to investigate Re responses to heatwaves, focusing on temperature sensitivity ( Q 10 ) and thermal hysteresis. We develop a quantitative framework capturing hysteresis via temperature thresholds, their seasonal timing, and phase‐specific Q 10 indices ( Q 10, I , warming phase; Q 10, II , cooling phase). Flux‐tower observations from the 2003 and 2018 heatwaves showed widespread amplification of thermal hysteresis in comparison with years without heatwaves. This amplification was primarily driven by asymmetric shifts in thermal sensitivity, especially a dominant decline in Q 10, II . The response of ecosystem respiration after summer is the most affected in years that have experienced strong heatwaves at most sites. Q 10, II retains strong associations with the timing of optimal temperature ( r = 0.55), whereas Q 10, I becomes largely decoupled. Principal component analysis further confirms this divergence, with the two phase‐specific sensitivities varying along orthogonal axes under heatwaves. We further analyzed individual sites to see how much each Q 10 phase contributed to the overall change in temperature sensitivity. Across sites, the temperature sensitivity of respiration in the post‐heatwave phase accounts for an average of 71% of the total phase‐specific Q 10 change induced by heatwaves. This reinforces the central role of Q 10, II in amplifying thermal hysteresis. Structural equation modeling shows that the heatwave‐amplified thermal hysteresis in Re is fully mediated by Q 10, II decline, shaped by both thermal thresholds and their seasonal timing. These findings reveal a phase‐asymmetric temperature sensitivity of Re that underpins thermal hysteresis, suggesting that short‐term heatwaves could trigger prolonged carbon losses even under post‐peak warming scenarios.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70691

Singh,"ABSTRACT Soil protists significantly influence ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) through their roles in microbial predation, parasitism, and organic matter decomposition. However, the multifaceted contributions of protist diversity, along with its interactions with other microbial groups and plant diversity, to EMF—especially under climate‐induced stresses such as drought—remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a factorial microcosm experiment, manipulating microbial diversity (protists, bacteria and fungi), plant species richness, and drought stress. In total, 203 microcosms were established, generating 812 soil samples and 2436 amplicon sequencing libraries. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) and multiple regression analyses, we found that protist diversity was positively correlated with EMF, carbon sequestration, soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition, and nutrient cycling. Furthermore, protist communities exhibited distinct, phylum‐specific relationships with these ecosystem functions. Under drought conditions, microbial interaction networks experienced significant restructuring, with protists emerging as keystone taxa—enhancing protist connectivity and highlighting their central role in ecosystem resilience, especially in relation to leaf carbon dynamics. Our findings provide novel empirical evidence that protists act as multitrophic integrators in soil ecosystems and highlight their role in buffering ecosystems against global environmental change.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70692

However, given their high sensitivity to climate extremes such as extreme drought, the persistence and adaptability of these diversity‐productivity relationships under rapid climate changes remain poorly understood. To address this, we established a grassland experiment at two proximate sites with distinct natural plant and AM fungal communities, imposing two contrasting extreme drought regimes (intense and chronic), each exceeding a 20‐year recurrence interval based on site‐specific precipitation records. We show that AM fungal diversity consistently outperforms plant diversity in predicting plant aboveground/net primary productivity (ANPP/NPP), as well as compositional shifts in plant species productivity, despite pronounced drought sensitivity in both communities. Notably, enhanced drought resistance in plant productivity was primarily associated with the stability of AM fungal richness rather than plant richness, highlighting their mutual dependence under extreme drought. Structural equation modelling confirmed that AM fungal richness buffered drought effects on ANPP, NPP and plant richness, with stronger effects on ANPP and NPP than those of plant richness and soil properties. These results suggest that AM fungal diversity may play a greater role than plant diversity in buffering plant communities against climate extremes. While causality remains to be fully resolved, these findings shed light on the adaptive significance of this ancient symbiont in sustaining ecosystem functioning under rapid climate change.",,,0.85,,,,,,False,0,10.1111/gcb.70697

Sofonea; Michael France; Nicolas Tessandier; Ignacio G Bravo; Carmen Lia Murall; Jacques Ravel; Samuel Alizon,"<p>by Tsukushi Kamiya, Mircea T. Sofonea, Michael France, Nicolas Tessandier, Ignacio G Bravo, Carmen Lia Murall, Jacques Ravel, Samuel Alizon</p> The vaginal microbiota is associated with the health of women and newborns alike. Despite its comparatively simple composition relative to other human microbiota systems, the mechanisms underpinning the dynamics and stability of vaginal microbial communities remain elusive. A crucial, yet so far underexplored, aspect of vaginal microbiota ecology is the role played by nutritional resources. Glycogen and its derivatives, produced by vaginal epithelia, are accessible to all bacterial constituents of the microbiota. Concurrently, free sialic acid and fucose offer supplementary nutritional resources to bacterial strains capable of cleaving them from glycans, which are structurally integral to mucus. Notably, bacteria adept at sialic acid exploitation are often correlated with adverse clinical outcomes and are frequently implicated in bacterial vaginosis (BV). In this study, we introduce a novel mathematical model tailored to human vaginal microbiota dynamics to explore the interactions between bacteria and their respective nutritional landscape. Our resource-based model examines the impact of the relative availability of glycogen derivatives (accessible to all bacterial species) and sialic acid (exclusive to some BV-associated bacteria) on the composition of the vaginal microbiota. Our findings elucidate that the success of BV-associated bacteria is intricately linked to their exclusive access to specific nutritional resources. This private access fortifies communities dominated by BV-associated bacteria, rendering them resilient to compositional transitions. We empirically corroborate our model prediction with longitudinal clinical data on microbiota composition and previously unpublished metabolomic profiles obtained from a North American cohort. The insights gleaned from this study shed light on potential pathways for BV prevention and treatment.",,,1.0,,,,,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003575

Bernhardt</p> The superficial white matter (SWM), immediately beneath the cortical mantle, is thought to play a major role in cortico-cortical connectivity as well as large-scale brain function. Yet, this compartment remains rarely studied due to its complex organization. Our objectives were to develop and disseminate a robust computational framework to study SWM organization based on 3D histology and high-field 7T MRI. Using data from the BigBrain and Ahead 3D histology initiatives, we first interrogated variations in cell staining intensities across different cortical regions and different SWM depths. These findings were then translated to in vivo 7T quantitative myelin-sensitive MRI, including T1 relaxometry (T1 map) and magnetization transfer saturation (MTsat). As indicated by the statistical moments of the SWM intensity profiles, the first 2 mm below the cortico-subcortical boundary were characterized by high structural complexity. We quantified SWM microstructural variation using a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method and examined the relationship of the resulting microstructural gradients with indices of cortical geometry, as well as structural and functional connectivity. Our results showed correlations between SWM microstructural gradients, as well as curvature and cortico-cortical functional connectivity. Our study provides novel insights into the organization of SWM in the human brain and underscores the potential of SWM mapping to advance fundamental and applied neuroscience research.",,,1.0,,,,,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003629

Miller, Gabriela Cardozo, Margarita Chiaraviglio, Lee A. Fitzgerald, Sergio Naretto, Frank J. Mazzotti</p> Invasive species impose major ecological and economic costs on ecosystems and countries where introduced. To effectively manage Argentine black and white tegus (<i>Salvator merianae</i>) within their invasive range, it is important that management actions are based on species’ biology. We estimated tegu percentage fat and body condition in native (Cordoba, Argentina) and non-native (South Florida, United States) populations and identified biological, temporal, and environmental variables that influence tegu body condition in South Florida. Large adult tegus in Cordoba had larger fat reserves than tegus in South Florida. However, body condition values were highly similar between the native and non-native range throughout the year, showing a well-adapted tegu population to South Florida environmental conditions. Generalized additive mixed models (size estimate = 2.67) showed very strong (p-value < 0.001) to moderate (p-value <0.01) evidence of Julian day, minimum temperature, and percentage fat individually affecting tegu body condition in South Florida (deviance explained 37%). The direction and magnitude of univariate effects varied from positive linear relationship (minimum temperature) impacting body condition up to 18% to negative (Julian day) and positive (percentage fat) monomodal relationships impacting body condition up to 24% and 6%, respectively. Our results provide insights as to how adaptable tegus are physiologically to novel environments and their capability to maintain body condition that is similar to, or better than that of native individuals. These findings can inform management in Florida by identifying seasonal windows when tegus’ activity and condition may make them more susceptible to targeted removal.",,,1.0,,,,,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0342916

Nasif Ahsan; Md. Nazrul Islam,"<p>by Md. Tanvir Hossain, Tunvir Ahamed Shohel, Md. Nasif Ahsan, Md. Nazrul Islam</p> The resources of the Sundarbans mangrove forest have provided livelihoods for communities in Bangladesh and India that depend on it. However, the role of the Sundarbans in ensuring the household dietary diversity of Sundarbans mangrove forest resource-dependent communities (SMFRDCs) remains unexplored. Considering the Sustainable Livelihood Approach, this cross-sectional survey study was conducted in three coastal districts (Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat) to assess the prevalence and determinants of dietary diversity among SMFRDCs. Data were collected using a structured interview schedule from 782 households selected through a multistage stratified random sampling process over three months in 2023. Relevant statistical tests were conducted to assess the prevalence of dietary diversity and identify its determinants among households in the immediate vicinity of the Sundarbans. The one-sample binomial test showed that honey collectors and households in Shyamnagar <i>Upazila</i> had higher dietary diversity than those involved in other occupations and residing in other areas. The results of the binary logistic regression analysis indicated that individuals with higher education and those involved in multiple seasonal occupations were more likely to have diversified diets; however, spatial location had an inverse effect on the diets of SMFRDCs. Household assets, including domestic, transport, and livestock assets, as well as livelihood capitals such as social, natural, financial, and political, were positively associated with a diversified diet. In contrast, human and physical capital were negatively associated with household dietary diversity. The findings further show that physical vulnerability, along with household food insecurity, negatively affected dietary diversity among forest-proximate households. To ensure a sustainable, proper, and protein-enriched diet for forest-resource dependent people in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, context-specific, tailored, and well-integrated strategies are needed, including promoting alternative livelihoods, such as climate-smart agriculture, along with awareness regarding the consumption of locally available nutritious foods and government-aided food assistance programs, specifically during seasonal unemployment. Moreover, to improve access to diversified food items essential for the physical and mental development and well-being of forest-adjacent marginalized communities in coastal Bangladesh, certain factors suggested by the Sustainable Livelihood Approach, such as vulnerability, assets, policies and structures, and livelihood strategies, should be considered to ensure the sustainability of livelihood and resources, especially for climate-vulnerable communities.",,,1.0,,,,,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0342800
1043,Determining the reliability of the Vitalight CO<sub>2</sub> Monitor via the assessment of the carbon dioxide profile on city transit buses,,,,,0.0,PLOS ONE,C,na,Courtney E. Lessel; Katie A. Goggins; Alison A. Godwin,"<p>by Courtney E. Lessel, Katie A. Goggins, Alison A. Godwin</p> Public transit vehicles represent small, dynamic, indoor spaces, with conditions that can be favourable for the development of poor air quality. The use of CO<sub>2</sub> monitors is recommended as a potential strategy for improving ventilation; however, information around how non-experts can use them for personal monitoring is limited. The purpose of this field study was to assess the real-world usability of a low-cost monitor, and to provide general recommendations around personal risk assessment using a monitor in combination with the evaluation of environmental factors. Measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> and surveying of commute conditions were carried out with two CO<sub>2</sub> monitors, the Vitalight and the Aranet, during 250 public transit trips between October 17<sup>th</sup>, 2022 and July 18<sup>th</sup>, 2023. Results show that CO<sub>2</sub> measurements taken by the Vitalight and the Aranet were highly correlated (Time 1 (T1): r = .948; Time 2 (T2): r = .966). Additionally, the Vitalight paralleled the Aranet with respect to its responses to: temperature; relative humidity; occupancy level; seating position; how often the bus doors opened; and whether the windows were open or closed. However, measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> taken by the Vitalight were significantly lower than those taken by the Aranet (T1: <i>t</i>(249) = −22.52, p < .001; T2: <i>t</i>(249) = −32.44, p < .001). Based on these results, we make three recommendations to provide guidance to non-experts around personal monitoring for ventilation on transit buses, including use and interpretation of the Vitalight monitor, and environmental conditions to assess, to inform actions to take to improve ventilation.",,,0.9,,,,,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0342566

Lennox; Sebastian F. Stranzl; Einar Bye-Ingebrigtsen; Reidar Handegård; Gaute Velle,"<p>by Trond Einar Isaksen, Ulrich Pulg, Robert J. Lennox, Sebastian F. Stranzl, Einar Bye-Ingebrigtsen, Reidar Handegård, Gaute Velle</p> Gas bubble disease is a major concern for aquatic animals in rivers downstream of hydroelectric power plants, where water can become supersaturated with dissolved gas. While the disease is well documented in Pacific salmonids (<i>Oncorhynchus</i> spp.), its effects on juvenile Atlantic salmonids (<i>Salmo</i> spp.) and non-salmonid fish in Europe are limited or unknown. To assess the impacts of gas bubble disease in Norwegian rivers, experimental trials exposed juvenile Atlantic salmonids (<i>Salmo salar</i> and <i>Salmo trutta</i>) and adult European minnows (<i>Phoxinus phoxinus</i>) to dissolved gas supersaturation ranging from 100% (normal) to 120%. A total of 1 440 fish were included in the trials, comprising Atlantic salmon larvae (alevin, <i>n</i> = 250; fry, <i>n</i> = 250), salmon parr (<i>S. salar</i>, <i>n</i> = 325), brown trout parr (<i>S. trutta</i>, <i>n</i> = 340), and minnow (<i>n</i> = 250). The study also included a repeated trial with salmon parr (<i>n</i> = 25) and a reference trial with rainbow trout parr (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>, <i>n</i> = 25). Results showed both intra- and interspecific differences in tolerance to total dissolved gas supersaturation. Atlantic salmon larvae (alevins and fry) and European minnows tolerated higher supersaturation, showing low mortality and only subacute gas bubble disease pathogenesis at levels up to 120% total dissolved gas supersaturation. Acute disease occurred only in larger salmonid parr at 115–120%, with gas emboli in gills and subcutaneous emphysema appearing within 1–6 hours. At 120%, mortality rates were significantly higher (p < 0.003) in salmon and brown trout parr compared to rainbow trout parr, ranging from 1.2–7.5 dead or moribund fish per hour (LT<sub>50</sub> in 4–15 hours) versus 0.5 per hour in rainbow trout (LT<sub>50</sub> in 25 hours). Lethal time for 50% mortality (LT<sub>50</sub>) was used as a criterion for terminating the trials. Recovery tests were conducted only on salmon larvae and brown trout in our study, and the results indicated partial recovery following exposure to sublethal gas supersaturation. These findings define lethal and sublethal thresholds of gas supersaturation for multiple species and life stages, highlight lower mortality rate in rainbow trout compared to Atlantic salmonids, and present the first documented effects on the non-salmonid European minnow (Cypriniformes). The results provide a basis for assessing potential ecological impacts of total dissolved gas supersaturation in Norwegian and European rivers.",,,0.9,,,,,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0342556

However, it carries a risk of bleeding. This study analyzes its safety using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to guide clinical use and future research. Data from 2004 Q1 to 2024 Q3 were examined using Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) methods. Among 21,483,491 reports, 5,788 were related to fondaparinux, with 17,523 adverse events (AEs). The most affected systems were vascular (n = 2046) and blood/lymphatic (n = 1125). Abnormal coagulation factor X concentration, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, and incision site hematoma had the strongest signals. AEs were more frequent in females and elderly patients, especially within the first month. Additional Preferred Term (PT)–level signals defined in MedDRA were observed, including heparin induced thrombocytopenia and eosinophilia. Heightened pharmacovigilance particularly in older adults may be warranted.

1049,Factors influencing the functionality of medicines and therapeutic committees in public health facilities in Uganda: A longitudinal assessment,,,,,0.0,PLOS ONE,C,na,Benard Nsubuga; Anthony Ddamba; Harriet Akello; David Arinaitwe; Phillip Ampaire; Moses Kamabare,"<p>by Benard Nsubuga, Anthony Ddamba, Harriet Akello, David Arinaitwe, Phillip Ampaire, Moses Kamabare</p> World health organization estimates that of all medicines used globally, about 50% are used irrationally. This is mostly attributed to overuse of antibiotics and indiscriminate use of injectables, among other things. Globally, medicines and therapeutic committees (MTCs) play a significant role in combating inappropriate medicines use problems. This study explored the extent of the functionality of MTCs in health facilities in Uganda and the associated factors. This was a longitudinal assessment that utilised a semistructured questionnaire that was administered through face-to-face interviews. Panel data analysis techniques were used to compare results between the two waves. This study utilised the ordered logistic regression model and random effects techniques to determine the factors influencing the functionality of MTCs. Overall, the percentage of health facilities with a functional MTC significantly increased from 8.3% (22/264) in wave one to 20.8% (55/265) in wave two (p-value = 0.000). The percentage of MTCs that are partially functioning increased from 15.2% (40/264) in wave one to 29.1% (77/265) in wave two. The percentage of HFs with MTC structures increased from 2.6% to 42.6% in wave two. Health facilities without an MTC significantly reduced from 72% (190/264) in wave one to 7.6% (20/265) in wave two (p-value = 0.0000). The median number of MTC members significantly increased from 13 in wave one to 15 members in wave two (p-value = 0.0112). Level of care, availability of guidelines, availability of subcommittees, and MTC members being active were significantly associated with the performance of MTCs (p-value<0.05). The study established a significant improvement in the functionality of MTCs in health facilities attributed to interventions from national medical stores, Uganda’s ministry of health and implementing partners. The study, however, observed little improvement in the full functionality of MTC subcommittees. Continuous medical education interventions should be strengthened at all levels of care.",,,0.9,,,,,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0342487

To inform care delivery and resource allocation, this study identified hospitalization cost predictors among African American and Hispanic patients with diabetes in Southeastern Virginia.</p> Methods <p>We analyzed 6,011 hospital discharges from the Virginia Health Information database (2016–2020) for adults aged 18–85 with diabetes. Discharges were classified by Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Groups: DM with complications/comorbidities (DCC, n = 3,328), DM with major complications/comorbidities (DMCC, n = 1,518), and DM without major complications/comorbidities (DWO, n = 1,165). Because cost distributions were right-skewed (skewness 3.5–8.24), we used log-linear regression with robust standard errors and back-transformed coefficients to percentage changes.</p> Results <p>Mean age differed by classification: DWO 38.7 ± 17.2 years, DCC 47.4 ± 17.4, DMCC 54.9 ± 17.4. The cohort was predominantly African American (98.2–99.1%). For DWO, urgent admission was the strongest predictor, associated with 239.5% higher costs versus emergency admissions (95% CI, 220.8–258.2; p < 0.001). Other significant predictors included skilled nursing facility discharge (SNF) (69.7–119.2% increase), primary procedures (11.0–53.8% increase), and peptic ulcer disease (66.1–135.8% increase. Readmission effects varied by classification: in univariable models, readmission was associated with 5.8% lower costs in DMCC (p < 0.001); in multivariable models, this association attenuated and was not statistically significant (−3.5%; 95% CI, −9.0 to 2.3; p = 0.230). By contrast, DCC and DWO showed increases of 13.7% and 6.0%, respectively.</p> Conclusions <p>Admission type particularly urgent admissions among patients without major complications, was a key cost driver. Findings support risk stratification in all emergency departments, with priority in systems serving large proportions of minority patients. Heterogeneous readmission effects across classifications indicated the need for nuanced quality metrics. These results provided baseline data for predictive modeling to improve diabetes care and reduce disparities in minority populations.</p>",,,0.9,,,,,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0342483

This study focuses on the crucial issue of enhancing consumer engagement in Virtual CSR initiatives. Drawing upon the Theory of Planned Behavior and Perceived Risk Theory, this study empirically analyzes the factors influencing consumers’ willingness and behavior to participate in Virtual CSR activities through questionnaire surveys. Our findings reveal that behavioral attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and external scenarios positively impact consumer willingness to participate, which in turn significantly promotes participation behavior. Furthermore, willingness to participate serves as a mediator between these factors and actual participation behavior.

Ibrahim; Nahla E. Zakzouk,"<p>by Rania A. Ibrahim, Nahla E. Zakzouk</p> Accurate estimations of fuel consumption and carbon emissions insights are critical for performance benchmarking, emissions compliance, and the optimization of energy management strategies in vehicles’ systems. Unlike model-based predictive approaches that require complex modelling, machine learning (ML) predictive models learn patterns directly from data, w making them flexible, automated, and scalable solutions for complex nonlinear systems that can easily adapt to diverse sets of data with high predictive accuracy. These models typically span from linear and nonlinear models to ensemble approaches, where the latter are often preferred owing to their ability to aggregate multiple learners and more effectively capture intricate relationships.. This study develops a predictive ML framework for estimating vehicle emissions and fuel consumption in lightweight vehicles via a real-world dataset. The primary contribution of this work lies in the fusion and integration of internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) datasets into a common modelling workflow, whereas most existing studies rely solely on combustion-vehicle datasets only. Another contribution is the dual-forecast capability of the proposed model, enabling simultaneous prediction of both vehicle emissions and fuel usage rather than solely predicting emissions, as in most prior studies. In contrast, this study offers a unified framework capable of accurately forecasting both vehicle emissions and energy consumption. The adopted broader and more diverse mixed dataset enhances generalization, in addition to making the proposed model a practical and reliable tool for environmental assessment, sustainable vehicle development, and policy decision-making.",,,0.9,,,,,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0342418

In Zambia, data regarding trade remain limited. This study aimed to analyze its supply chain, perform a broad risk assessment of multiple zoonotic pathogens, and develop a sustainable wild meat trade framework.</p> Methods <p>A grounded theory–based qualitative study was conducted in Lusaka district between October 2023 and February 2024. Thirty-eight in-depth interviews were carried out with key informants from the government, conservation organizations, academia, butchers, and research sectors. The participants were selected using purposive sampling followed by snowballing. The inclusion criterion was individuals with professional or operational knowledge of the wild meat trade; the exclusion criterion included a lack of relevant expertise or refusal to provide informed consent. The interviews were conducted in English or Nyanja; Nyanja interviews were then translated to English. Interviews were transcribed using Whisper AI, and thematically analyzed using grounded theory by means of NVivo 12.</p> Results <p>The illicit supply chain includes poachers in protected areas, urban-based financiers, middlemen, and urban consumers. The species most commonly traded include buffalo, kudu, impala, warthog, and hippopotamus. The key zoonotic risk factors identified were unhygienic field processing, transport without refrigeration over distances >300 km, species misrepresentation (e.g., anthrax-infected hippopotamus sold as buffalo), and meat consumption from dead or snared animals. Poor enforcement and high demand in Lusaka sustain the trade. A sustainable wild meat trade framework was developed, focusing on community engagement, alternative livelihoods, game farming, and public health education.</p> Conclusion <p>Zambia’s illegal wild meat trade poses serious zoonotic risks due to unhygienic practices, poor oversight, and species misrepresentation. Reducing these risks requires multisectoral collaboration, stronger enforcement, behavior change strategies, and investment in sustainable livelihood alternatives for communities near protected areas.</p>",,,0.9,,,,,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0342396

1058,CLAS-Net: A study on cross-lingual intelligent sentiment analysis model fusing semantic alignment,,,,,0.0,PLOS ONE,C,na,Jia-Qi Wang,"<p>by Jia-Qi Wang</p> In the context of the deep integration of globalization and digitalization, the cross-lingual dissemination of news and public opinion information has become an increasingly significant challenge. This study proposes a novel cross-lingual sentiment analysis framework, CLAS-Net, designed to address the bottlenecks of current public opinion analysis systems in multilingual scenarios. The framework combines the cross-lingual contrastive learning capabilities of XLM-RoBERTa with the precise sentiment feature extraction ability of BiLSTM-Attention, enabling efficient analysis of multilingual public opinion. In monolingual tasks for English and Portuguese, CLAS-Net achieves accuracies of 92% and 89%, respectively, representing a 29 percentage point improvement compared to baseline models. In more challenging multilingual settings, CLAS-Net maintains a high accuracy of 83%, a 29 percentage point improvement over the baseline model. CLAS-Net (Cross-Lingual Alignment Sentiment Network) demonstrates strong adaptability and practical value when processing real-world social media and news data, providing reliable technical support for cross-lingual public opinion monitoring and analysis in the global context.",,,0.9,,,,,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0342342

Self, Andrés Camacho-Alpízar, Priya Binwal, Umama Mir, Stefan Stanescu, Benjamin A. Whittaker, Lauren M. Guillette</p> Culture, learned behaviours shared within a group, is found in diverse species and critically impacts fitness. Culture arises through social learning and persists when newcomers adopt group norms via conformity and conformist transmission. We examined conformity and conformist transmission in a novel context: avian nest building, testing whether male zebra finches, the primary nest builders in this species, forgo their preferred nest material colour in favour of the majority-demonstrated alternative, and whether the likelihood of switching was disproportionate relative to majority size. First, we determined each male’s preferred colour and preference strength. Then, each male, paired with a female, was introduced into a population containing four conspecific pairs, each incubating eggs in a nest. Populations varied in the number of nests (0–4) built using the male’s non-preferred colour material. After three days, males were given both material colours for nest construction. Males with weaker preferences were more likely to conform, using the majority-demonstrated, non-preferred colour, whereas males with stronger preferences resisted social influence. Although males often acquired social information – evidenced by their initial interactions with the majority-demonstrated material – this did not consistently translate into conformist nest-building behaviour. These findings show socially influenced nest-building and individual variation in susceptibility to social information.",,,0.9,,,,,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0342277

However, most simulation tools target late design stages, overlooking early phases where small geometric choices have an outsized performance impact. Through comparative software analysis and questionnaire survey, this study addresses the disconnect between designers’ workflows and existing tools, rooted in divergent thinking paradigms: designers’ design thinking and engineers’ scientific thinking. Accordingly, we propose “Energy Diagram,” a grey-box-based tool that integrates 2D Zonal models simplified by the Lattice–Boltzmann method with deep neural networks (DNNs) to predict wind fields by seamlessly coupling architectural diagrams with numerical simulations. Validation against wind-tunnel experiments, field measurements, and CFD simulations shows that, the mean MAPE of Energy Diagram is 16.85% (vs. experiments) and 10.45% (vs. simulations) for a cube case, and 19.21% (vs. measurements) and 13.79% (vs. simulations) for a reading-room case. Through application in an architectural studio, the characteristics of the tool, i.e., the visual integration, geometric transition, and human-machine collaboration, are verified and discussed. This research underscores the potential of human-centric tools to democratize performance simulation, empowering designers as proactive agents in sustainable architecture development.",,,0.9,,,,,,True,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0342247

Pelissero; Tewabe Negash; Emily R. Orlikoff; Isabell Osborne; April M. Tolley; Briana Pobiner; Michael C. Pante,"Fossilized trace marks left by our ancestors as they processed animals for food are important clues to the emergence and intensification of human carnivory and tool use. When studied in tandem with fossilized tooth marks made by carnivorous predators, butchery marks also help reconstruct the larger ecological framework and trophic dynamics of paleoecosystems. However, some taphonomic processes produce bone surface modifications that mimic the morphology of butchery marks, introducing the potential for misclassification when relying on imprecise criteria. The implementation of digital modeling techniques that allow the collection of microscopic quantitative data has begun to improve the reliability of mark identification. Although many digital taphonomy methods appear promising, their broader applications are limited by a lack of replicable methods, unpublished and closed-source databases, and statistical methodologies that violate core assumptions for accurate model inference. In this paper, we present an open-source database of experimentally generated cut, percussion, tooth, and trample marks measured and analyzed using high-resolution confocal profilometry and a replicable quantification protocol. Statistical classificatory models using our taphonomic measurement database can distinguish between experimentally generated bone surface modifications with 74% to 83% accuracy, depending on the comparative groupings. Our aim for these classification models is to facilitate accurate identification of the processes that created fossilized bone surface modifications, which is the first step to resolving long-standing debates surrounding the origins and evolution of human carnivory. Additionally, we hope that publishing our open-source data and code underscores the need for more replicable, collaborative, and transparent methods in paleoanthropological research.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2026.1681814
1064,Promote or inhibit: how climate policy uncertainty may shape extreme weather’s impact on grain production,,,,,0.0,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,C,ecology,Xiaojun Zhang; Ming Zhang; Ziyi Shi; Yixuan Luo,"Introduction While existing research recognizes that policy conditions can influence the link between climate change and agricultural output, a critical question has long been overlooked—even if policy direction is correct, if policies are volatile and unpredictable, they can themselves become a source of risk. How this policy uncertainty alters the relationship between climate change and agricultural production lacks in-depth exploration in academia. This study aims to fill this critical gap by specifically revealing how Climate Policy Uncertainty (CPU) moderates the effects of temperature and precipitation on grain yields. Methods This study employs panel data from 286 prefecture-level cities in China spanning 2001–2020. Based on the C-D production function, it adopts an economic-climate interaction model, incorporates CPU as a moderating variable, and conducts empirical tests using regression method. Results There exists a significant inverse U-shaped relationship between climatic factors and grain yields. However, when CPU increases, this relationship curve becomes significantly steeper, meaning the negative impact of extreme climate on grain yields is amplified. In other words, policy instability may exacerbate the destructive force of climate change. Further regional analysis reveals that this “amplification effect” of CPU is more prominent in non-major grain-producing areas: in the north, it primarily intensifies the precipitation-yield relationship, while in the south, it amplifies the temperature-yield relationship. It is noteworthy that in non-climate adaptation pilot cities, CPU exhibits a more pronounced negative moderating effect. Discussion The core implication of this research is that in the face of climate change, the clarity, coherence, and predictability of policies are themselves a crucial form of adaptive capacity. Ensuring policy stability can effectively stabilize farmers’ production expectations and incentivize long-term investments to combat climate risks. Further, the results also underscore the necessity of driving systemic transformation to convert external risks into endogenous drivers, then CPUs’ responses can be internalized as assets against future extreme weather within a risk framework in the future. Ultimately, anchoring climate-policy regimes in stable, Nature-Based Solutions—especially by advancing them across the Global South—offers a scalable pathway to turn policy uncertainty into ecological and social resilience.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2026.1753076

Philson; Omar Tonsi Eldakar; Michael J. Wade,"Natural selection is based on the concept of differential reproduction between entities, often characterized as a struggle between individual organisms. However, natural selection can act at all levels of biological organization, thus being termed “multilevel selection” (MLS). A common misconception is that selection across levels of biological organization lacks empirical support. To address this, we conducted a bibliometric review of 2,950 Web of Science/Scopus-indexed scientific articles, to document the range of taxa and research topics where MLS has been used to understand natural selection across levels. The 280 studies providing empirical support for selection at more than one level spanned a vast range of organisms, from viruses to humans to eusocial insects. They included research done both in natural populations (100) and in laboratory experiments (180). While 90.4% of studies focused on selection among organismal groups (e.g., demes, colonies, aggregates), another 9.6% explored selection across other levels (genetic elements, nuclei, cells, or multispecies communities). We classified studies by topic including artificial selection, breeding through group selection, indirect genetic effects, and contextual analysis, among others.

To address this gap, we surveyed 326 plots across 14 localities along a natural humidity gradient in northeastern Argentina, comparing fern diversity between climatically driven zonal habitats and more humid topographically or edaphically influenced azonal habitats. We found that azonal habitats supported greater fern richness than zonal ones in humid to semihumid regions, but this advantage disappeared towards the arid extreme, where both habitat types hosted equally poor communities. At the species level, only Christella hispidula and Doryopteris pentagona showed higher frequency patterns in azonal habitats toward drier conditions, whereas most species were more frequent in zonal habitats or showed no clear shift. Annual precipitation best explained variation in species richness, and soil conditions, such as salinity or unsuitable textures, may limit the capacity of azonal habitats to act as refugia under dry climates. Our findings reveal that humid microhabitats can act as refugia for ferns only under favorable moisture conditions, highlighting the need to account for local environmental heterogeneity and edaphic limitations when predicting biodiversity persistence under climate change.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2026.1719536

This study examines the gut microbiota composition of three captive crane species using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. The research addresses the critical role of gut microbiota in nutrient metabolism, immune regulation, and environmental adaptation, particularly under captive conditions where dietary shifts may disrupt microbial balance. Fecal samples from 45 juvenile cranes were collected, and genomic DNA was extracted for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bioinformatic tools were used to analyze microbial diversity, composition, and functional pathways. Significant interspecific differences were observed. The common crane’s microbiota was dominated by Bacillota (93.05%), enhancing cellulose degradation, while the Demoiselle Crane exhibited higher diversity with Pseudomonadota (21.95%) and Fusobacteriota (2.83%), reflecting omnivorous adaptations. The Red-crowned Crane showed intermediate Bacillota (78.32%) and notable Plesiomonas (12.48%), linked to aquatic diets. Alpha diversity was lowest in Demoiselle Cranes, and beta diversity revealed pronounced structural divergence. Functional analysis identified species-specific adaptations, such as alcohol detoxification in wetland cranes and pyruvate fermentation in arid-adapted Demoiselle Cranes. Captivity influences crane microbiota composition, with interspecific differences driven by evolutionary dietary specialization. The findings underscore the need for tailored dietary management in conservation programs to maintain microbial health and host adaptability.

By contrast, terrestrial ecosystems host only a narrow set of mixotrophic plants, and no animal is known to rely substantially on endogenous photosynthesis or plastids over its life cycle. Here I argue that this asymmetry is not paradoxical once mixotrophy is viewed through three coupled filters: ecological state spaces, evolutionary accessibility and physiological feasibility. I outline how these filters differ between water and land, how they jointly compress the adaptive zone for mixotrophy after terrestrialization, and how they generate explicit, testable predictions for future empirical and theoretical work on dual nutritional strategies.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2026.1755631

However, δ 15 N values from domestic cat hair suggest an unexpectedly low trophic level or reduced isotope enrichment for these obligate carnivores. We explored two explanations: (i) an isotopic shift of cat diet toward lower δ 15 N values than human food, or (ii) a lower trophic discrimination factor (TDF) in cats than humans, resulting in smaller 15 N enrichment of cat hair. Reduced TDFs may arise from protein limitation during fur growth or from a close match between dietary and body protein amino acid composition. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the N isotope composition of cat and human food, human hair, and cat hair and whiskers. Cat hair δ 15 N values (6.63 ± 0.13 ‰) plotted close to human vegan hair 7.18 ± 0.06 ‰) but were significantly lower than human omnivore hair (8.83 ± 0.03 ‰). Hypothesis (i) was rejected, as cat diet δ 15 N values were higher than mixed human diet, whereas hypothesis (ii) was supported, with low cat TDFs averaging 1.61 ± 0.44 ‰ compared to human TDFs of 4.73 ± 0.09 ‰. Protein limitation from seasonal coat growth was rejected, since whiskers and fur were isotopically identical. Thus, high diet quality and close amino acid matching between diet and body protein likely caused reduced trophic 15 N enrichment. These findings indicate protein quality can outweigh protein quantity in determining trophic N isotope fractionation in domestic cats.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2025.1699291

Here, we analyze dental microwear patterns of H. pentlandi teeth from three fossil-rich caves (Maccagnone, San Ciro, and Cannita) to reconstruct its diet and assess potential ecological adaptations. The results indicate a significantly higher number of pits compared to both extant H. amphibius and extinct continental taxa ( H. antiquus , H. gorgops ), suggesting greater ingestion of exogenous grit. The absence of puncture pits excludes a hard fruit feeding behavior, pointing instead toward a grazing diet influenced by increased dust intake. Differences in microwear among localities may reflect variable exposure to open, arid environments across Sicily during the Middle–Late Pleistocene.

We hypothesized that EWEs would reduce periphytic algal diversity, weaken community stability. Results revealed that EWEs significantly decreased periphytic algal biomass (by 92.9% ± 2.9%), richness (1.3% ± 0.2%), evenness (21.5% ± 4.0%), and Shannon diversity (7.0% ± 1.4%) (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Additionally, these events destabilized the co-occurrence networks by reducing node connectivity, centrality, and complexity, resulting in structural simplification that diminished the system’s ability to withstand disturbances. Floods specifically increased water velocity (58.1%) and created shading, leading to a decline in algal diversity. In contrast, blizzards drastically reduced water temperature (69.5%), posing severe survival challenges to the algal communities. It was concluded that EWEs reduced community’s diversity by altering habitat heterogeneity and weakened network stability through changing in species’ adaptation and community shifts. Water temperature and velocity were identified as key drivers of community composition changes during EWEs.

In tropical island regions facing the combined pressures of human activities and climate change, understanding the mechanism underlying the phytoplankton community structure is crucial. This knowledge is essential for safeguarding drinking water sources and for identifying potential ecological risks in aquatic systems. Methods This study focused on 22 drinking water sources on Hainan Island, comprising 11 rivers and 11 reservoirs. Phytoplankton samples were collected during December 2023 (dry season) and July 2024 (wet season). We systematically analyzed the α and β diversity, explored the environmental factors influencing community changes, and examined the mechanism underlying the assembly of the phytoplankton community. Results and discussion The results revealed a clear seasonal succession in the composition of the dominant phytoplankton community. During the dry season, Cyanophyta , Chlorophyta , and Bacillariophyta were dominant, whereas in the wet season, Cyanophyta dominated. Phytoplankton α-diversity was consistently higher in rivers than in reservoirs and β-diversity was predominantly structured by species turnover (&amp;gt;84%). The Mantel test identified water temperature, pH and total phosphorus as key environmental factors influencing changes in the phytoplankton community structure. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that during the wet season, the phytoplankton community nodes exhibited higher connection density and stronger correlations. The assembly of these community was primarily governed by dispersal mechanism, with niche processes playing a comparatively minor role.

However, its fishery resources have been severely depleted due to human activities, leading to a scarcity of data regarding its genetic characteristics. This study aims to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of this species to provide a scientific basis for its conservation. Methods Three mitochondrial DNA markers—Cytochrome b (Cyt b ), Control Region (D-loop), and Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit I (COI)—were sequenced and analyzed. A total of 100 samples were collected from three natural populations in the lower Yarlung Zangbo River: Motuo (MT), Palong (PL), and Chayu (CY). Results High overall haplotype diversity (H d : 0.889–0.951) but relatively low nucleotide diversity (P i : 0.00450–0.0111) were observed. Notably, the PL population exhibited the lowest genetic diversity across all markers. Significant genetic differentiation was detected between the PL population and the other two populations (MT and CY), supported by F ST indices, gene flow ( N m ) estimates, and Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), which revealed that most variation resided within populations (&amp;gt;83%). Both Neighbor-Joining (NJ) phylogenetic trees and haplotype network analyses indicated a distinct geographical lineage pattern, with the PL and CY populations showing a distant genetic relationship.

The unique natural and cultural geography in the China-Vietnam border region provides relatively undisturbed habitats for ancient trees. Cross-border activities, policy disparities, and uneven conservation resources currently challenge their survival and diversity. Methods A study was conducted in Chongzuo city, a typical border city, to quantify the species diversity, abundance and distribution of ancient trees, and their relationship with varied habitats. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified the primary factors influencing their spatial patterns. Results The results identified 15,722 ancient trees from 99 species, 73 genera and 35 families. Twenty-nine species were solitary with only one individual each, and 14 were listed as protected plants in China. The population was dominated by Camellia drupifera , Ficus altissima , Dimocarpus longan , and Excentrodendron tonkinense , collectively accounting for 84.05% of the recorded trees. Ancient trees decreased with tree age, height, DBH, and crown width, with the majority (95.33%) in the 100–299 years age group. More natural habitats, including mountains, villages, and farmlands, supported the highest trees abundance, while parks, nature reserves, and scenic spots accommodated the greatest species richness. Pingxiang township had the highest tree abundance (9,118), while Longzhou had the highest species richness (50). Ningming, however, had the largest Shannon-Wiener index ( H = 2.42), making it the most important district for preserving tree diversity. Land area, built-up area, GDP, population density, forest coverage, farmland area, and altitude significantly influenced the distribution of ancient trees. Discussion The inherently high landform and habitat diversities in the study area support many ancient tree species.

Billions are invested each year into creating new compounds to combat pests, pathogens, and cancer cells, yet resistance evolves swiftly and repeatedly. This recurring failure stems not from a lack of innovation but from a lack of integration. Current strategies are predominantly developed within disciplinary and taxonomic silos, and often ignore the evolutionary nature of resistance. This topic is extremely relevant and contemporary as the emergence of resistance is an evolutionary inevitability whenever a population is exposed to strong selection pressures such as xenobiotic compounds. Despite this, resistance management remains reactive and compound-specific, relying on successive chemical innovations rather than long-term strategies. In this piece, the authors argue that resistance is not a domain-specific phenomenon, but a general evolutionary process. Drawing together research across insects, bacteria, fungi, plants, and cancer biology, this Perspective outlines how comparative insights and integrative strategies can reshape the way we approach resistance in both agricultural and biomedical systems. To confront this pressing and pervasive issue — where evolution outpaces our interventions — we must adopt an integrative evolutionary perspective that is anticipatory, not reactive. Resistance to xenobiotics is a shared evolutionary outcome across life forms, and so too should be our approach to solving it. This Perspective will serve as a conceptual bridge for researchers across domains, encouraging coordinated, evolutionary-informed solutions to one of the most pressing challenges of our time.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2026.1719781

While the long-term consequences of invasion are poorly understood, the fossil record can be used to assess the impacts of past invasions on ecosystem structure and functioning on evolutionary timescales. During the Late Ordovician (Katian), ~445.25 million years ago, deglaciation and subsequent rising sea level connected formerly isolated shallow epicontinental seas, facilitating the invasion of over 75 genera through larval dispersal in several pulses known as the Richmondian Invasion. Here we examine 1,139 species from these benthic marine communities of the Cincinnati Arch (USA) to quantify the effects of invasive species on functional diversity, which has been shown to influence ecosystem dynamics, stability, productivity, and functioning. Changes in functional diversity were quantified across six 3 rd -order stratigraphic sequences to assess the impacts of invasion using functional traits readily identifiable in fossil taxa: tiering above the substrate, feeding mode, motility/attachment, structural robustness, trophic rank, vision, and body form. We find that despite well documented changes in community composition, the arrival of invaders did not significantly add new functional entities or dramatically alter functional diversity, and invaders largely occupied pre-existing functions. While there were changes across the invasion, community structure ultimately returned to a state similar to the pre-invasion community. This suggests that despite changes in community composition across the Richmondian Invasion, ultimately the invasion did not substantially restructure functional diversity, as we observed little change in the number of functions, functional redundancy and over redundancy, vulnerability, and the distribution of species among functional entities. These findings emphasize the decoupling of changes in community composition and functional diversity, and the importance of functional diversity in assessing the potential ecological impacts of marine invasions today.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2025.1706877

Of the 38 taxa analysed, nine were identified as native and 29 as non-native, providing new evidence that Lemna minor and Lemna gibba , previously regarded as invasive in South Africa, are native species. Ecological niche models developed using MaxEnt and bioclimatic variables projected current and future habitat suitability under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) across three global climate models (MIROC6, EC-Earth3-Veg, and UKESM1-0-LL). Current suitability was found to be the highest in the coastal provinces (KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, and Western Cape). Future projections revealed model-dependent outcomes, with MIROC6 and EC-Earth3-Veg predicting net expansion of climatically suitable habitat, particularly in inland provinces such as Mpumalanga, Limpopo, North-West, and Gauteng while UKESM1-0-LL consistently predicts contraction. The congruence between phylogenetic identity and projected range shifts highlights regions and freshwater systems vulnerable to future duckweed invasions. By integrating evolutionary history with climate projections, this study provides a robust framework for refining invasive species management, conserving native freshwater flora, and guiding adaptive conservation planning under climate change in South Africa.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2025.1715912

We surveyed residential plants on Baltimore, MD, and Washington, D.C. blocks, documenting differences in structure, richness, and community composition along an income gradient and between abandoned and neighboring occupied properties. Both canopy and ground vegetation on low-income residential properties covered less area and were more likely to contain non-native species than their higher-income counterparts, with different tree, vine, and non-native communities present.

A key requirement of monitoring is the accurate identification of species, a particular challenge with cryptic species. This study introduces a non-invasive footprint identification technology to classify two cryptic sengi species ( Elephantulus myurus and Elephantulus intufi ) - key bioindicators in the rapidly changing Southern African biomes. Front footprints were collected, using a custom Small Mammal Reference Track box, from live-captured individuals that were identified by experts in small mammal taxonomy and verified through genetic analyses. Morphometric features of the footprints (lengths, angles and areas) were extracted using JMP software. Linear Discriminant Analysis, based on nine key variables, achieved a mean classification accuracy of 94–96% across training, validation, and test datasets, robustly distinguishing the two species using a single footprint image. By integrating our field capture locations with data from the IUCN expert-defined ranges and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, we demonstrate that FIT empowers non-experts to contribute reliable, high-resolution occurrence data. This scalable approach has the potential to transform community-science efforts, improving the accuracy of species distribution maps and ultimately strengthening conservation outcomes. Planned advancements include open-ended track tunnels and expanded machine learning models to monitor more small mammals in at-risk ecosystems. This approach offers a scalable, low-impact alternative to traditional trapping and genetic methods, reduces animal stress, morbidity and mortality, and empowers local communities to enhance data quality and monitoring through integration with traditional ecological knowledge.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2025.1719684

Blair,"In the bison industry, both heifers and bulls are marketed and harvested at various ages, generally ranging from 20 to 30 months. Bulls represent the greatest proportion of the slaughter mix, as the bison industry does not routinely castrate, leaving males intact throughout the growing and finishing phase. This practice makes bulls available for use during the breeding season prior to the finishing phase. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of bull age and use in the breeding herd on carcass characteristics, meat quality, and sensory characteristics of bison bulls. Grass-finished bison bulls were assigned to one of two finishing treatments: 1) Young bulls (n = 98) finished on fall pasture and harvested at 30 months of age with no exposure to the breeding herd, or 2) Mature bulls (n = 24) finished on early summer pasture and harvested at 36 months of age following use in the breeding herd. Bison were harvested, carcass data were recorded, and striploins were collected for the analysis of meat quality attributes. Mature bulls had greater hot carcass weight, ribeye area, kidney fat percentage, and marbling score compared to Young bulls. Objective tenderness was affected by the interaction of postmortem aging and finishing treatment. Steaks from Young bison bulls were more tender at all aging time points compared to steaks from Mature bison bulls. Variation in tenderness between treatment groups was likely not due to differences in collagen, as total collagen was greater in steaks from Young bulls. Consumer panelists rated steaks from Mature bulls higher for toughness intensity and flavor liking and lower for off-flavor intensity. Trained panelists rated steaks from Young bulls higher for flavor intensity, while ratings for toughness and juiciness were increased for Mature bulls. Collectively, results from this study indicate that bulls used in the breeding herd and marketed at 36 months of age produced heavier carcasses. However, Mature bulls were tougher at all postmortem aging days and required 21 days of aging to reach an acceptable level of tenderness, which was detected by both trained and consumer panelists.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2025.1688932

Short,"Introduction Many species are shifting their geographic ranges in response to changing climate, and identifying climate impacts on future species distributions will be critical for conservation success. North American bison (Bison bison) provide an exceptional study system for exploring the use of an interdisciplinary record of paleontological, archaeological, and historical data for conservation due to the plethora of past occurrences across a large geographic and temporal scale, in combination with their “near-threatened” designation by the IUCN Red List because of current small, fragmented populations following a near-extinction event in the 1880s. Moreover, the multiple identities of bison as free-roaming wildlife, as wildlife with limitations, and as captive semi-domesticated livestock introduce unique conservation concerns across the four sectors of the Bison Management System (BMS; Tribal, private, public, nonprofit-NGO). Methods To model bison climate suitability using “Bioclim”, we associated 1,774 bison occurrences over the last 21,000 years with three PastClim variables (warmest temperature of the warmest month, temperature seasonality, and precipitation of the coldest quarter) that were identified as the strongest predictors of past bison distributions using a variance inflation factor. The model was projected onto the WorldClim RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 future climate scenarios for the four remaining 20-yearperiods to 2100 CE and onto the WorldClim 2.1 version of current climate, to determine expected changes in climate suitability. Results The distribution of suitability scores changes rapidly, shifting significantly between each 20-year interval until the end of the century. By 2100, the centroid of suitable climate, using the standard 50% threshold, is expected to shift from its current location near the 49th parallel to the northwest and toward the northern border of Canada by 1,182 km under the RCP4.5 climate scenario and 2,254 km under the RCP8.5 climate scenario. Suitability ranges above the optimal minimal threshold identified by the receiving operator characteristic (8.5%) are also predicted to shift to the northwest by 793 km under RCP4.5. and 1267 km under RCP8.5. Discussion With an anticipated geographic shift in the most suitable bison climate, it is necessary to prepare future management strategies for BMS sectors to maintain a sustainable relationship with bison.",,,0.8,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2025.1695457

Martín Hechenleitner; Gerald Grellet-Tinner,"We report a new Fossil-Lagerstätte at the Cretaceous hydrothermal field of Sanagasta, La Rioja, northwestern Argentina, which opens a window into the paleobiology of an exceptionally preserved fossil ecosystem. Active geothermal systems harbor a diverse microbial life that thrive in high temperature, unique mineral composition and fluctuating pH. These environments are dominated by a meso- and hyperthermophilic community, including bacteria and archaea, that proliferate around the hot springs and geysers. In these environments, fossilization occurred rapidly by abiotic factors and through biomineralization—chiefly biosilicification. This process is mediated by thermophilic microorganisms, mainly cyanobacteria, allowing for the exceptional preservation of the biota. Here, we describe an ~80 million-year-old fossil extremophile biocoenosis encrusted within microbialites from the Sanagasta paleohydrothermal field. The core of the microbialites was explored using petrography, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analyses in SEM. These microbialites exhibit remarkable three-dimensional preservation of microorganisms through extensive biosilicification, directly mediated by the extremophile communities. The taxonomic range of the sinterized assemblage encompasses the three domains: a noteworthy array of thermophilic ‘prokaryotes’ (chiefly bacteria and archaea), along with a rich diversity of eukaryotic ‘protists’ microorganisms (i.e., amoebozoans, myxomicetes, red algae, diatoms, and alveolates), green algae, plant remains, fungi and a variety of arthropod remains, all preserved in notable microanatomical details.

Zinnert; John Wnek; Amy Williams; Eric McGivney; Kailey Matthews; Alexander Sabo; Stephanie M. Dohner,"Gaps in our understanding of the interplay between biotic and abiotic forces shaping coastal dunes inhibit our ability to fully understand their evolution and predict topographic changes. The theoretical evolution of a dune system begins with nebkha formation. This formation begins around individual dune-building plants, which grow over time around groups of plants. Individual nebkha mounds can meld into one another, growing in size and complexity based on the dune-building vegetation population. To better understand ecogeomorphological feedbacks driving these relationships, we tested how plant density impacts nebkha formation by Ammophila breviligulata in both a laboratory and a field setting. Laboratory tests consisted of using a wind tunnel to control abiotic forces, focusing on the effects of varying plant density in nebkha formation. We tested three low densities commonly supporting backshore nebkha: an individual (one plant) and small groups (five and nine plants). In the field, we used both remote sensing and field techniques to quantify the relationship between stem density and the nebkha shape and size of backshore A. breviligulata nebkha. In the wind tunnel, stem density was not as strong a predictor of nebkha size or shape as number of leaves and aboveground biomass, both of which increased with growing stem and plant densities. Stem density was a strong predictor of nebkha size and shape, with increasing variability at increasing densities in both the laboratory and field. In situ measurements of stem density are performed inconsistently among field experiments due to the effort required. Therefore, strong allometric scaling among A. breviligulata morphology metrics can help overcome limitations around what can be collected in the field or in a modeled environment containing limited plant metrics. In situ , vegetation stabilization frequently allowed the nebkha to grow steeper than would be expected based on grain size and the angle of repose. These differences in field and laboratory nebkha highlight the importance of grounding laboratory work in field collections for the interpretation of their results in nature. Understanding the underlying ecogeomorphic feedbacks involved in nebkha formation is critical to scaling up modeling efforts to forecast coastal foredune evolution, recovery, and storm response in the face of climate change.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fevo.2025.1691144

The shrimp Exopalaemon modestus is one of the most abundant native shrimps in China and also predate on zooplankton. The predation rhythm of juvenile crayfish on zooplankton and how it differs from native shrimps remain to be studied. We elucidated the predation rhythms of juvenile and sub-adult crayfish and shrimps on Simocephalus mixtus , a common Cladocera in the littoral region of freshwater lakes. Predation rates during the day or at night were measured for juvenile crayfish (~3.75 cm in body length), sub-adult crayfish (~6.68 cm) and juvenile shrimp (~3.88 cm) at different zooplankton densities (18, 54, 108 ind./L representing low, medium and high natural densities, respectively). The results showed that (1) juvenile crayfish predated slightly more at night than during the day, and with significantly higher predation rates than sub-adult crayfish; (2) Juvenile shrimp predated significantly more at night than during the day, as predation was almost absent during the day; (3) Juvenile shrimp had slightly higher night-time predation rates than juvenile crayfish, however, their daytime predation rates were significantly lower at medium and high zooplankton densities. Juvenile crayfish fed for a longer period than shrimp of similar length, exhibiting higher feeding capacity on zooplankton which supports the inherent superiority hypothesis that invasive species possess advantages over native species in feeding capacity.

Renowned for its rich biodiversity, China hosts a high concentration of threatened species, particularly amphibians. However, incomplete species inventories have hindered current understanding of biodiversity and impeded conservation efforts. Here, we compiled records documenting the formal scientific discovery of previously undescribed amphibian species in China between 1765 and 2022, with the intent to summarize associated trends and identify key predictors thereof. During that over 250‐year timespan, while the total number of authors increased, more than 60% of those authors described only one species, highlighting a skewed pattern in productivity. Notably, resident (domestic) taxonomists have gradually surpassed their non‐resident (international) counterparts in contributions and now play a central role in species discovery. Over time, the factors that affect the discovery probability of species have shifted, yet the degree of activity among taxonomists remains the most consistent driver. Despite increased effort, local taxonomists face growing challenges due to limited personnel and time.

Wendt; Michael Neeley; Mio Alt; Stephanie A. Ewing; Georgianna S. Fischer; David B. McWethy,"Understanding how ecological and social constraints interacted to shape bison hunting systems during the late Holocene reveals the dynamic ways bison hunting strategies adapted to changing conditions. At the Bergstrom site in central Montana, bison were hunted intermittently for roughly seven centuries before archaeologically visible use ceased near 1100 cal yr BP. To explain why hunting stopped despite continued regional bison presence, we integrate archaeological excavation, radiocarbon chronology, and multiproxy riparian paleoecology (pollen, charcoal, coprophilous fungal spores) with regional drought reconstructions and analysis of radiocarbon-dated bison occurrences. Local environmental proxies show stable vegetation, low fire activity, and persistent large-herbivore indicators after abandonment, providing little support for ecological transformation as a cause. Regional synthesis reveals that archaeological bison frequencies increased 5.5-fold through the Holocene while paleontological frequencies remained stable, with peak hunting intensity coinciding with severe, multi-decadal droughts. These findings contradict models of population tracking and indicate that hunting reorganization, not prey scarcity, led to site abandonment. The most parsimonious explanation is convergence of constraints: drought reduced processing water at hydrologically marginal sites while rising organizational demands favored larger, infrastructure-intensive communal operations. The abandonment of the small Bergstrom site likely reflects an adaptive reorganization of bison hunting efforts toward larger, topographically advantageous sites better suited to increasingly coordinated communal hunting systems. This case study illustrates how historical hunting systems maintained regional persistence through episodic site use and localized abandonment, providing empirical guidance for contemporary managers seeking to restore the spatial heterogeneity and adaptive capacity that supported bison-human systems under climatic variability.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fcosc.2025.1688950

Ranglack,"American bison ( Bos bison ) were spared from numerical extinction but considered to be ecologically extinct, partially due to spatial restrictions in their former range. A key component of the ecological function of bison is their ability to adjust their spatial behaviors at multiple scales to match the seasonal distributions and availability of resources. To understand how management influences the amount and seasonality of space bison use at various scales, we estimated home range using autocorrelated kernel density estimators (95% utilization distribution) and foraging patch size by the maximum variance in first-passage time at four temporal scales (annual, growing, nongrowing, and focal seasons) for two free-ranging and three captive bison herds. The seasonal differences in space-use within management regimes and study areas were treated as nonparametric related measures while differences amongst management regimes and study areas were treated as nonparametric independent measures. Seasonal variations in space-use were detected in both management regimes, but only free-range bison depicted this pattern at the larger home range scale (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Free-range bison had significantly larger home ranges across seasons compared to captive bison (p &amp;lt; 0.001), but captive bison had larger foraging patch sizes during the growing season than free-range bison. Study areas with captive bison did not differ in their amount of space-use at any scale or season (p &amp;gt; 0.05). The strongest differences were apparent among study herds in annual home range size (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and growing season foraging patch size (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Our results demonstrate that captivity likely prevents bison from using their available landscape seasonally at broad scales, which could have ecological consequences for this historically nomadic herbivore. Although sociopolitical realities prevent bison restoration at a continental scale, increasing the amount of space available to bison where possible has the potential to replicate previous ecological processes.

Increasing our understanding of the functionality of the different designs and localities of underpasses is therefore crucial within infrastructure planning and management. We analyzed crossing probability, based on movement-triggered automatic cameras, in moose ( Alces alces ) and roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ), common wild ungulates in Scandinavia, in relation to underpasses with different designs and localities. We analyzed the design through passage width, height, and length, including different combinations of these size dimensions. We also categorized underpasses into three size levels considering all dimensions. We included the nearest distance to the alternative crossing site while controlling for season, group size, and whether wildlife visits occurred during daytime or nighttime. We compared 797 visits by moose across nine underpasses and 1,433 visits by roe deer across 13 underpasses. Increasing tunnel length lowered the crossing probability in both moose and roe deer. Tunnel length not exceeding 16.5 m had a crossing probability above 50% in moose, whereas tunnel length not exceeding 12.0 m had a crossing probability above 50% in roe deer. However, we found no correlation between crossing probability and passage width and height. Tunnel length may describe a perceived narrowness more efficiently than other size dimensions. In roe deer, crossing probability increased when alternative crossing sites were situated further away, whereas moose showed a tendency toward the same pattern. Nearest distances to alternative crossing sites farther away than 1,150 m were related to more than 50% probability of roe deer visits resulting in crossing through underpasses. Thus, we conclude that tunnel length (ranging from 7.0 to 39.0 m) and nearness to alternative sites to cross seem to be more important factors than other size dimensions among underpasses (with passage width ranging from 2.8 to 42.0 m and passage height ranging from 2.0 to 10.2 m) to explain crossing probability in wild ungulates. The impact on crossing probability from the availability of other crossing sites stresses the importance of securing crossing opportunities along infrastructure barriers at the home range scale of focal species.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fcosc.2026.1751415

It draws parallels to the well-established Forest Transition Curve, which describes how forest cover changes over socio-economic development stages: initial deforestation, stabilization, and eventual reforestation. It is proposed that a similar pattern may exist for rivers, linking water quality and river health to economic development and land use change. Therefore, understanding the temporal evolution of rivers, comparable to forest transitions, could inform more effective watershed management policies. In the context of Central America, rivers face significant degradation due to pollution, overexploitation, deforestation, climate change, and infrastructure modifications like channelization. This study characterized water quality in the Liberia River (Costa Rica) and Tela watersheds (Honduras), identifying key management challenges. Furthermore, it conducted citizen perception sounding surveys on water management and held water education workshops in schools and communities within these watersheds. The results indicated chronic fecal contamination in all rivers studied in Honduras and Costa Rica, extending to coastal zones. This finding underscores the need for enhanced wastewater infrastructure management and stricter enforcement of water quality standards to protect environmental and community health. Surveys and workshops suggested that targeted water education significantly enhances community knowledge and empowerment, which are critical drivers for improved participatory water governance. Rather than proposing direct policy prescriptions, this study offers conceptual and empirical insights to inform future policy development and support more integrated and sustainable water governance in the region.

These partnerships between communities and external investors aim to conserve biodiversity and deliver sustainable socioeconomic benefits. Guided by the Cognitive Hierarch Model (CHM), the research examines how values, beliefs and contextual experiences shape community judgements of JVs. Methods We employed a mixed-methods approach, including household surveys with 548 respondents across nine villages (three from each of the Burunge, Enduimet and Randilen WMAs) and 20 Key Informant Interviews. The surveys captured respondents’ perceptions of JV benefits, conservation-related factors and demographic information, while key informant interviews provided deeper contextual perspectives on wildlife tourism partnerships. We analyzed the quantitative data using an ordinal cumulative link mixed model and applied thematic analysis to the qualitative data to determine the acceptability of JVs in WMAs. Results We found that community acceptability of JVs is positively influenced by perceived socio-economic benefits, including financial opportunities, support for public infrastructure, access to employment in tourism facilities and support for local microenterprises. However, limited recognition or awareness of investor contributions to wildlife protection can reduce community willingness to accept and support JVs. Education and positive expectations of tourism growth further enhance acceptability, while negative experiences related to conservation foster skepticism. Observed variations across WMAs and among households highlight the need for place-based governance and locally tailored approaches to ensure that JV outcomes align with community priorities. Discussion/originality This study offers a novel application of CHM to the context of wildlife tourism, moving beyond socioeconomic impact assessments to explore psychological and contextual drivers of community acceptability of JVs.

Methods: We compared serum vitamin E and whole blood selenium concentrations in wild, recently captured donkeys with concentrations in donkeys who had been managed in captivity for at least half a year at the time the blood was drawn. In addition, we assessed hematology and serum biochemistry parameters of a subset of the donkeys. We also indirectly analyzed the diet of wild donkey herds using next-generation sequencing of fecal samples. Our last goal was to establish reference intervals for vitamin E and selenium concentrations in wild and rescued donkeys.

The vitamin E reference range for wild female donkeys was 211-754 μg/dL and for wild male donkeys was 164-780 μg/dL; the selenium reference range for wild female donkeys was 8-21 μg/dL and for wild male donkeys was 12-26 μg/dL. The fecal analysis found a mixed feeding behavior in the wild donkeys, with both grazing and browsing elements, which may explain the relatively high concentrations of these nutrients.

Martin; Carter G. Kruse; Tom K. Bragg; Philip M. Urso,"Trace minerals found in the diet are essential for animal health, but the role of mineral supplementation in maintaining bison health or boosting immune response is relatively unknown. This study evaluated the impact of an oral drench supplement containing Co, Cu, Se, and Zn—minerals associated with immune function—in reducing mortality and maintaining health in response to a Mycoplasma bovis outbreak in yearling bison. A total of 1,295 mixed-sex, non-reproductive yearlings were studied, with 464 receiving the supplement and 831 serving as controls. Mortality totaled 238 individuals (18.4%), with no statistically significant difference between groups (Pearson’s χ² test, p &amp;gt;0.05), indicating supplement ineffectiveness. Blood analysis confirmed no change in mineral status, suggesting that the supplement formulation, intended for cattle, may not meet bison-specific requirements. Water quality analysis of water sources used in the study revealed elevated Fe and manganese levels, but other mineral imbalances were not evident. Growth rates and final weights did not differ significantly between treatment and control groups, although males consistently outweighed females. Parasitological analyses showed minor differences in gastrointestinal nematode burdens, with no apparent link to supplementation or mortality. Serology results indicated significant differences but were likely of limited biological relevance. Finally, the study highlighted the potential implications of frequent bison handling for research or other purposes, which may increase stress and disease susceptibility. These findings underscore the need for bison-specific mineral information, as well as diagnostic, prevention, and treatment strategies to improve health management in this species.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fcosc.2025.1689030

Fradkin,"Across the western United States, introductions of non-native fish into historically fishless mountain lakes have impacted native biota. Understanding the impacts of fish introductions is essential for conservation in Olympic National Park, a Biosphere Reserve. We reconstructed fish plantings using records dating back to 1930, followed by environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys to estimate the current distribution of fish and amphibians in 117 remote mountain lakes. We used Bayesian multiscale occupancy models to determine how lake attributes and planting history related to fish and amphibian occupancy. The most frequently detected species were Brook Trout, Rainbow Trout, Cascades Frog, and Northwestern Salamander. eDNA sampling revealed 52 lakes with amphibians only, 45 with fish and amphibians, 14 with fish only, and 6 unoccupied. Of the 53 lakes with planting records, 38 had fish eDNA detected. Fish eDNA was also detected in 21 lakes lacking planting records, which could reflect incomplete records, unauthorized plantings, and false positive detections. Of the three species planted, Cutthroat Trout had the highest failure rate and did not become established in 23 of 28 historically planted lakes. In a subset of 9 lakes sampled for up to 7 years, those with known fish and amphibian presence showed consistent eDNA detections over time. The number of times a lake was stocked was the best predictor of occupancy for Brook and Rainbow trout, while higher occupancy for Brook Trout was also associated with lower elevations, lower solar radiation, and larger lake area. We did not observe widespread negative associations between amphibian occupancy and fish presence, although there was a negative relationship between fish presence and Rough-skinned Newt and Long-toed Salamander occupancy. Cascades Frog occupancy showed no relationship to fish presence or lake traits. Our results suggest mechanisms of fish persistence over time and highlight areas where native amphibians are impacted by introduced fish. These results can guide management options like targeted fish removals that benefit native fauna while still supporting recreational fishing. More broadly, our work demonstrates the value of combining historical records with contemporary surveys and the utility of eDNA for broad-scale surveys of species distribution in remote wilderness areas.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fcosc.2025.1698619

Positive messaging by advocates of the wildlife fashion industry frequently promotes products as sustainably sourced and beneficial for species conservation. To assess potential veracity of conservation claims by the wildlife fashion industry we conducted a rapid evidence assessment, brief survey, and novelty stress-test regarding data used by key regulatory sectors concerning four example species within the sector (Australian saltwater crocodiles ( Crocodylus porosus ), reticulated pythons ( Malayopython reticulatus ), Burmese pythons ( Python bivittatus ), and South African ostriches ( Struthio camelus australis )). We collated information via online literature searches, requests to government agencies, and the CITES Secretariat. No relevant data were provided by any government agency nor by CITES to support claims that the wildlife fashion industry benefits conservation of the four target species. We conclude that reliance on the commercial sector for objective and impartial data or other input appears imprudent, and that both the nature and source of information used for policy-making requires transparency and reform. We recommend wider use of the precautionary principle, which should be supported with high-level monitoring and enforcement, as well as improved information and education.",,,0.9,,,,,,False,0,10.3389/fcosc.2025.1719758

Longo; Elena Azañón,"Abstract Tactile spatial perceived distance between two touches is larger on sensitive skin regions. While such distortions are substantial for the perception of distance between two distinct touches, they are significantly reduced when participants estimate the size of a single continuous object touching the skin. Here, we examine whether some of the mechanisms involved in processing the distance between two touches are shared with and influence those underlying the perception of continuous objects, leveraging adaptation aftereffects. In experiment 1, participants adapted to specific distances between two points, and we assessed the effect on both point-based and continuous object perception. Experiment 2 tested whether adaptation to continuous objects influenced distance perception similarly. Results showed that two-point adaptation induced aftereffects of similar magnitude for both two-point and object stimuli, while adaptation to continuous objects produced larger aftereffects specifically for object stimuli. These results indicate that aftereffects generated by simple touches generalize across different stimulation types, whereas those induced by continuous objects remain stimulus specific. Therefore, it is reasonable to assert that the distance perception of two touches arises at early stages of tactile processing that subsequently affects perception at later stages. Whereas distance perception of continuous objects is processed at later stages and is object specific.",,,,,,,,,False,1,10.1098/rspb.2025.2678

Here, we show that a colder winter tends to be followed by a hotter summer over Eurasia. This winter–summer extreme temperature reversal is linked to the phase switch of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) from winter to summer, which is driven by the North Atlantic air–sea interaction and Arctic sea ice–atmosphere coupling. Specifically, a negative AO in winter weakens high-latitude westerlies, causing cold extremes over Eurasia. Negative AO also induces a tripolar sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in the North Atlantic that persists into the following summer and triggers positive AO-like atmospheric anomalies, leading to a hotter summer across Eurasia. Moreover, winter atmospheric anomalies reduce the Barents–Kara sea ice through horizontal moisture transport. This sea ice loss persists into summer and contributes to the formation of positive AO-like atmospheric anomalies. These processes establish a cross-seasonal transition from extreme cold winters to extreme hot summers over Eurasia, offering new insight into the prediction of summer extreme events.",,,,,,,,,False,1,10.1088/1748-9326/ae4116

Vano; Nans Addor; Flavio Lehner,"Abstract The Colorado River supplies water to nearly 40 million people, 4.5 million acres of irrigated land, 29 federally recognized Tribes, and supports over 4,200 MW of hydropower capacity across the U.S. and Mexico. River discharge is strongly controlled by snowpack accumulation and melt in the headwater regions, making upper-basin snow dynamics a primary driver of water availability throughout the basin. Therefore, changes in snow water equivalent (SWE) are critical for water resources planning in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB), yet there is considerable uncertainty even in historical SWE trends. We compare historical UCRB SWE trends across various gridded snow products, including new WRF simulations at 45-, 9-, and 3-km resolution, against Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) station data. We find that SWE trends are systematically amplified with higher model resolution and that high resolution (&lt;10 km) is needed to accurately capture not only SWE amounts but also historical SWE declines across high-elevation mountains. Trend amplification primarily results from higher resolution simulations having higher snowfall due to stronger orographic forcing, an effect further modulated by synoptics. This is confirmed in a set of alternative historical realizations from a downscaled climate model large ensemble, which, despite a tendency for SWE declines, highlight the important role of internal variability in historical UCRB SWE trends. These results demonstrate that model resolution plays an important role in shaping assessments of snow-related climate change, with implications for a wide range of impact studies.",,,,,,,,,False,1,10.1088/1748-9326/ae4113
432,Long run emulator calibration increases warming and sea-level rise projections,,,,,,Environmental Research Letters,A,applied_ecology,Christopher D Wells; Donald P Cummins; Haozhe He; Chris Smith,"Abstract Owing to their short runtime compared to Earth system models (ESMs), as well as the difficulty for the latest ESMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to reproduce historical warming and the so-called ‘hot model problem’, constrained reduced-complexity climate models (‘emulators’) are increasingly used to produce global warming projections from emissions scenarios. Emulators are often calibrated on idealised abrupt CO 2 quadrupling experiments from CMIP6, particularly the global surface temperature response over time to an imposed radiative forcing. Such CMIP6 experiments tend to be run for 150 years, which is not sufficient to reveal the full equilibrium response to an imposed climate forcing. Here we show that, when longer experiments are available for emulator calibration, the long-term climate warming projections increase, particularly for 2100, by up to 0.70 (0.42–0.93, 25th to 75th percentile) °C in the median under a high emissions scenario; peak global warming in a high overshoot scenario is higher by 0.24 °C (0.14–0.31 °C). Corresponding long-term thermosteric sea level rise (SLR) is consequently higher, by 0.45 (0.22–0.52, 25th to 75th percentile) m in 2500. This result, consistent across calibrations from 17 ESMs, has implications for climate change mitigation strategies, as it is likely that even more stringent emissions reductions would be required to limit long-term warming and SLR than previously thought.",,,,,,,,,False,1,10.1088/1748-9326/ae3847

Achieving high-replication and thorough mutation characterization remains technically and financially challenging for long genes. Here, we developed an efficient, affordable, and scalable library construction approach that relies on low-cost DNA synthesis and standard cloning technologies, which will increase accessibility to mutational studies and help advance the field of protein science. Each degenerate codon variant is physically associated with multiple DNA barcodes during synthesis, which overcomes the need for long-read sequencing for linking variants to barcodes. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach by constructing a complete library for <i>PDR1</i>, a 3.2 kb multidrug resistance gene encoding a pleiotropic transcription factor in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>.

Ruff,"<p>by Jie Hu, Marius Moisa, Christian C. Ruff</p> Cooperation, productivity, and cohesion in human societies depend on altruism, the tendency to share resources with others even though this is costly. While altruism is a widely shared social norm, people vary strongly in their inclination to behave altruistically, in particular across situations with different types of inequality in resource distribution. What neurobiological factors underlie this variability? And can these be targeted by interventions to enhance altruistic behavior? Here, we build on electroencephalography (EEG) evidence that altruistic choices during disadvantageous inequality correlate with oscillatory gamma-band coherence between frontal regions (representing other’s interest) and parietal regions (representing neural evidence accumulation). We apply a transcranial alternating current stimulation protocol designed to exogenously enhance this fronto-parietal coherence and find that this leads to increased altruism, specifically during disadvantageous inequality as hypothesized based on the EEG findings. Computational modeling reveals that this transcranial entrainment does not just add noise to the decision process but specifically increases the weight individuals assign to other-regarding concerns during choices. Our findings show that altruism can be enhanced by neurostimulation designed to enhance oscillatory synchronization between frontal and parietal areas. This establishes a neural basis for altruism and identifies a neural target for interventions aimed at improving prosocial behavior.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003602

We found that CUL5 knockout promoted the sensitivity of bladder cancer cells to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated killing both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, CUL5 loss reduced the ubiquitination of PTBP1, which regulated alternative splicing of RUBCN pre-mRNA and led to an increase in the levels of the RUBCN-S isoform, thereby preventing immune evasion of bladder cancer cells by inhibiting autophagy. Importantly, CUL5 knockout significantly enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in a xenograft model. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel mechanism of bladder cancer immune evasion, providing potential targets for cancer immunotherapy.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003647

The endocytic protein AP180 is critical for efficient vesicle recycling at presynaptic terminals, and its loss impairs neurotransmission, producing reduced release frequency, enlarged synaptic vesicles, and increased quantal amplitude. Yet how AP180 controls vesicle size and whether vesicle size influences release remains unclear. Here, we show that the C-terminal Assembly domain (AD) of AP180 determines vesicle size and thereby regulates release properties in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. An AP180 variant lacking the AD (AP180∆AD) increases release frequency, contrasting sharply with the reduced transmission in <i>ap180</i> null mutants, yet fails to correct the vesicle size or quantal amplitude. These enlarged vesicles evade curvature-dependent inhibition by complexin, a presynaptic regulator of fusion, while remaining dependent on complexin for evoked responses. This selective escape reveals that vesicle size influences release dynamics through curvature-sensing proteins. Replacing the AP180 AD with actin-binding motifs restores normal vesicle size, quantal amplitude, and release frequency, indicating that actin interactions are both necessary and sufficient for AD function. Biochemically, we show that the intrinsically disordered AD forms condensates that enrich actin monomers and nucleate filament assembly, while full-length AP180 couples PIP2-rich membranes to actin filaments. Together, these findings reveal that the AP180 AD regulates synaptic vesicle size through actin binding, establishing vesicle morphology as a key influencer of curvature-dependent release control.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003643

Using in situ imaging of mouse model, we showed that brain-resident microglia vigilantly detect capillary-residing <i>C. neoformans</i> prior to its blood–brain barrier transmigration, but are less responsive to nonencapsulated fungi or parenchyma-injected <i>C. neoformans</i>. Microglia migrate to and enwrap leaky capillaries harboring fungi, leading to fungal uptake but not clearance, instead promoting fungal growth. Microglial response is triggered by released capsule components, rather than the assembled capsule. In particular, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) plays a critical role by activating endothelial cells to release nucleotides which act on microglia P2Y12.

Háden, István Winkler, Giacomo Novembre</p> The ability to anticipate rhythmic and melodic structures in music is considered a fundamental human trait, present across all cultures and predating linguistic comprehension in human development. Yet, it remains unclear the extent to which this ability is already developed at birth. Here, we used temporal response functions to assess rhythmic and melodic neural encoding in newborns (<i>N</i> = 49) exposed to classical monophonic musical pieces (real condition) and control stimuli with shuffled tones and inter-onset intervals (shuffled condition). We computationally quantified context-based rhythmic and melodic expectations and dissociated these high-level processes from low-level acoustic tracking, such as local changes in timing and pitch. We observed encoding of probabilistic <i>rhythmic</i> expectations only in response to real but not shuffled music. This proves newborns’ ability to rely on rhythmic statistical regularities to generate musical expectations. We found no evidence for the tracking of <i>melodic</i> information, demonstrating a downweighting of this dimension compared to the rhythmic one. This study provides neurophysiological evidence that the capacity to track statistical regularities in music is present at birth and driven by rhythm. Melodic tracking, in contrast, may receive more weight through development with exposure to signals relevant to communication, such as speech and music.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003600
1016,The human dorsal anterior cingulate facilitates acceptance of unfair offers and regulates inequity aversion,,,,,,PLOS Biology,B,na,Shotaro Numano; Chris Frith; Masahiko Haruno,"<p>by Shotaro Numano, Chris Frith, Masahiko Haruno</p> Bargaining is a fundamental social behavior in which individuals often accept unfair offers. Traditional behavioral models, based solely on choice data, typically interpret such acceptance as simple reward-maximization. However, regulating inequity aversion may also play a critical role in these decisions. Incorporating response time alongside choice data allows us to quantify participants’ internal mental effort when deciding to accept unfair offers. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants played the ultimatum game, deciding within 10 s whether to accept or reject monetary offers from a proposer. Using the drift diffusion model (DDM), we quantified decision-making dynamics based on both choice and response time. Participants with lower levels of behavioral disadvantageous inequity (DI) aversion (reflected by a lower DDM weight for DI) showed stronger neural representations of DI in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Functional connectivity analysis revealed a negative correlation between the dACC and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) when DI was high. This connectivity predicted both rejection rates and response times associated with the acceptance of DI offers. Furthermore, robust linear regression showed that only dACC-vlPFC connectivity—not reward-related activity—explained both the rejection rates and response times. Finally, right vlPFC activity correlated with amygdala activity under high DI conditions. These findings suggest that the dACC plays a key role in regulating responses to DI, thereby facilitating the acceptance of unfair offers.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003007

Solis; Nancy Scott; Christopher Zajac; Scott G. Filler; Anna Selmecki,"<p>by Xin Zhou, Audrey Hilk, Norma V. Solis, Nancy Scott, Christopher Zajac, Scott G. Filler, Anna Selmecki</p> Drug resistance is a critical challenge in treating life-threatening fungal infections. Here, we uncover a mechanism of acquired azole resistance in <i>Candida albicans</i> through mutations in <i>CAP1</i>, encoding a conserved fungal transcription factor that mediates the oxidative stress response. We analyzed 300 clinical isolates and identified 25 distinct <i>CAP1</i> missense or nonsense mutations, with many occurring within the DNA-binding domain. We identified two nearly identical <i>CAP1</i> heterozygous nonsense mutations, one in an isolate obtained from a bloodstream infection and one in a population of cells undergoing adaptation to fluconazole in vitro. Both <i>CAP1</i> nonsense mutations resulted in loss of the C-terminal nuclear export signal, leading to nuclear retention of Cap1 and subsequent activation of genes associated with the oxidative stress response and drug transport. The <i>CAP1</i> C-terminal truncations conferred significant fitness advantages in the presence of fluconazole, both in vitro and in a murine model of candidiasis. Strikingly, we discovered a therapeutic vulnerability: azole concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration were fungicidal to mutants with the <i>CAP1</i> C-terminal truncation. The fungicidal effect was attributed to both elevated azole-induced reactive oxygen species and a compromised oxidative stress response in Cap1-truncated cells. Our results provide novel characterization of de novo <i>CAP1</i> point mutations emerging in both laboratory and clinical contexts, elucidate the mechanisms underlying Cap1-regulated stress responses, and reveal a potential therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance in <i>C. albicans</i> infections.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003631

Salamango,"<p>by Nicholas Saladino, Emily Leavitt, Hoi Tong Wong, Jae-Hoon Ji, Diako Ebrahimi, Daniel J. Salamango</p> Hijacking of host DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways to facilitate virus replication is broadly conserved amongst diverse viral families. It has been well established that the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr induces constitutive DDR signaling and G2/M cell cycle arrest, but the virologic function of this activity remains unclear. Here, we use a combination of functional, pharmacologic, biochemical, and genetic approaches to establish that virion-associated and <i>de novo</i> Vpr proteins induce DDR responses that trigger global epigenetic remodeling and activation of transcription programs to enhance HIV-1 promoter activity during acute infection and reactivation from latency. Functional, genetic, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments reveal that Vpr segregates into two functionally discrete pools—a multimeric pool in the nucleus associated with chromatin and a monomeric pool in the cytoplasm associated with a host E3-ubiquitin ligase. Vpr-induced DDR and epigenetic remodeling activities are present in common HIV-1 subtypes circulating globally and in patient-derived isolates.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003621

While two soluble pseudoproteases, CspC and CspA, were initially identified as the germinant and co-germinant receptors, respectively, in <i>C. difficile</i>, we previously identified residues in an unstructured region of CspC that regulate the sensitivity of <i>C. difficile</i> spores to both signals. However, the mechanism by which CspC transduces these signals remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CspC forms a stable complex with CspA and determine the crystal structure of the CspC:CspA heterodimer. The structure reveals extensive interactions along the binding interface, including direct interactions between the unstructured region of CspC and CspA. Using structure-function analyses, we identify CspC:CspA interactions that regulate the sensitivity of <i>C. difficile</i> spores to germinant signals and show that CspA regulates the response of <i>C. difficile</i> to not only co-germinant but also germinant signals. While we show that CspA can form a homodimer and determine its crystal structure, CspA homodimerization appears unimportant for <i>C. difficile</i> spore germination. Collectively, our analyses establish the CspC:CspA heterodimer, rather than its individual constituents, as a critical signaling node for sensing both germinant and co-germinant signals. They also suggest a new mechanistic model for how <i>C. difficile</i> transduces germinant signals, which could guide the development of therapeutics against this important pathogen.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003610
1022,Grik2b and Grik2c kainate receptors regulate oviposition in <i>Bactrocera dorsalis</i>,,,,,,PLOS Biology,B,na,Bin Liu; Jingwei Yang; Long Ye; Yang Xiao; Guohong Luo; Muyang He; Guy Smagghe; Yongyue Lu; Daifeng Cheng,"<p>by Bin Liu, Jingwei Yang, Long Ye, Yang Xiao, Guohong Luo, Muyang He, Guy Smagghe, Yongyue Lu, Daifeng Cheng</p> Oviposition holds crucial significance for insect reproduction. Nevertheless, the research on the neural conduction mechanism of oviposition is still rather limited in most agricultural pests. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved Kainate receptors (KARs) expressed in the glutamatergic neurons (GNs) and the ovipositor neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) regulate the oviposition behavior in <i>Bactrocera dorsalis</i>. We identified two KARs (Grik2b and Grik2c), which control the oviposition behavior by influencing both oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Protein-ligand interaction indicated that glutamate serves as the neurotransmitter of Grik2b and Grik2c. Knockdown glutamate-coding genes adversely impacted oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Specific knockdown Grik2b (or Grik2c) in the GNs and NMJs could respectively influence oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Finally, inhibitors of KARs were screened for their ability to inhibit oviposition. Our study provides strong supporting evidence that a novel neural conduction mechanism for oviposition by uncovering the diverse roles of KARs and provides potential molecular target controlling insect oviposition.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003609
1023,Epimutations driven by RNAi or heterochromatin evoke transient antimicrobial drug resistance in pathogenic <i>Mucor</i> fungi,,,,,,PLOS Biology,B,na,Ye-Eun Son; Carlos Pérez-Arques; Joseph Heitman,"<p>by Ye-Eun Son, Carlos Pérez-Arques, Joseph Heitman</p> Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat emerging through microbe adaptation, driven by genetic variation, genome plasticity or epigenetic processes. In this study, we investigated how the <i>Mucor circinelloides</i> species complex adapts to the antifungal natural product FK506, which binds to FKBP12 and inhibits calcineurin-dependent hyphal growth. In <i>Mucor bainieri</i>, most FK506-resistant isolates (90%) were found to be unstable and transient, readily reverting to being drug sensitive when passaged without drug, and with no associated DNA mutations. In half of the isolates (50%), FK506-resistance was conferred by RNAi-dependent epimutation in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silenced the <i>fkbA</i> encoding FKBP12 post-transcriptionally. In contrast, most of the remaining FK506-resistant isolates (40%) were found to have undergone heterochromatin-mediated silencing via H3K9 dimethylation, transcriptionally repressing <i>fkbA</i> and neighboring genes. In these heterochromatic epimutants, only minimal enrichment of siRNA to the <i>fkbA</i> locus was observed, but in three of the four examples, siRNA was significantly enriched at a locus distant from <i>fkbA</i>. A similar mechanism operates in <i>Mucor atramentarius</i>, where FK506 resistance was mediated by ectopic heterochromatin silencing of <i>fkbA</i> and associated genes with siRNA spreading across the region. Heterochromatin-mediated <i>fkbA</i> epimutants exhibited stability during in vivo infection, suggesting epimutation could impact pathogenesis. These findings reveal that antifungal resistance arising through distinct, transient epimutation pathways involving RNAi or heterochromatin, highlighting adaptive AMR strategies employed by ubiquitous eukaryotic microbes.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003598

Sex steroids and sex chromosome-linked immune response genes have major roles in driving these differences, but the cells and signaling pathways governing these are disease-specific and often not known. Such knowledge is required to better understand sex differences in disease incidence and clinical course, and to provide treatments tailored to sex-divergent pathways underlying specific diseases.

1026,A gut-activated NHR-86–CYP pathway mediates the neuroprotective effects of <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> probiotics in a nematode model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,,,,,,PLOS Biology,B,na,Yu Sang; Jie Ren; Alejandro Aballay,"<p>by Yu Sang, Jie Ren, Alejandro Aballay</p> Neurodegenerative diseases are often associated with oxidative stress, and while probiotics may influence neuronal health, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using the <i>sod-1</i> A4V<sup>M</sup> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, we investigated the protective effects of the probiotic <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> against oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration. Animals fed <i>E. faecium</i> showed reduced motor neuron degeneration under oxidative stress compared to those maintained on a standard <i>Escherichia coli</i> diet. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant enrichment of oxidoreductase genes, including cytochrome P450 (<i>cyp</i>) genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>cyp</i> genes impaired <i>E. faecium</i>-mediated neuroprotection, and this loss correlated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. We identified the conserved nuclear hormone receptor NHR-86 as a key regulator of <i>cyp</i> gene expression and neuroprotection. Loss of <i>nhr-86</i> abolished the probiotic’s protective benefits, while transgenic expression of <i>nhr-86</i> restored <i>cyp</i> induction and neuronal resilience. Importantly, intestinal expression of NHR-86 was sufficient to restore CYP induction and neuronal resilience, whereas neuronal knockdown had no effect, indicating that gut NHR-86 activity is essential for this protective pathway. These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized NHR-CYP regulatory axis activated by an intestinal probiotic, highlighting a mechanistic link between microbial signals and host neuroprotection.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003627
1027,Five energy metabolism pathways show distinct regional distributions and lifespan trajectories in the human brain,,,,,,PLOS Biology,B,na,Moohebat Pourmajidian; Justine Y. Hansen; Golia Shafiei; Bratislav Misic; Alain Dagher,"<p>by Moohebat Pourmajidian, Justine Y. Hansen, Golia Shafiei, Bratislav Misic, Alain Dagher</p> Energy metabolism involves a series of biochemical reactions that generate ATP, utilizing substrates such as glucose and oxygen supplied via cerebral blood flow. Energy substrates are metabolized in multiple interrelated pathways that are cell- and organelle-specific. These pathways not only generate energy but are also fundamental to the production of essential biomolecules required for neuronal function and survival. How these complex biochemical processes are spatially distributed across the cortex is integral to understanding the structure and function of the brain. Here, using curated gene sets and whole-brain transcriptomics, we generate maps of five fundamental energy metabolic pathways: glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and lactate metabolism. We find consistent divergence between primarily energy-producing and anabolic pathways, particularly in unimodal sensory cortices. We then explore the spatial alignment of these maps with multi-scale structural and functional attributes, including metabolic uptake, neurophysiological oscillations, cell type composition, laminar organization and macro-scale connectivity. We find that energy pathways exhibit unique relationships with the cellular and laminar organization of the cortex, pointing to the higher energy demands of large pyramidal cells and efferent projections. Finally, we show that metabolic pathways exhibit distinct developmental trajectories from the fetal stage to adulthood. The primary energy-producing pathways peak in childhood, while the anabolic pentose phosphate pathway shows greater prenatal expression and declines throughout life. Together, these results highlight the rich biochemical complexity of energy metabolism organization in the brain.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003619

A deeper understanding of immunoregulatory mechanisms would provide new targets and combination therapeutic strategies for tumor therapy. In this study, we demonstrate that HSD17B12 enhances anti-tumor immunity and represents a promising therapeutic target. Mechanistically, HSD17B12 promotes lysosome-dependent degradation of PD-L1 via the VAC14 and ESCRT complexes across various malignancies, regardless of its 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase activity. HSD17B12-deficient cells displayed PD-L1 accumulation in both tumor cells and exosomes, reducing T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Notably, we found a significant negative correlation between HSD17B12 and PD-L1 expression in colorectal cancer tissues. Furthermore, high HSD17B12 expression in CRC correlated with increased infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. Based on these findings, we designed a peptide, HSD-CC1-NPGY, which effectively reduces PD-L1 expression in cells and suppresses tumor growth in a mouse model. Overall, our results establish HSD17B12 as an important regulator of anti-tumor immunity and a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003603

This limits our ability to precisely experimentally address the early developmental trajectories towards these outcomes. Here, we utilize deep learning to predict the differentiation path and resulting tissues in retinal organoids well before they become visually discernible. Our approach effectively bypasses the challenge of organoid-related heterogeneity in tissue formation. For this, we acquired a high-resolution time-lapse imaging dataset comprising about 1,000 organoids and over 100,000 images enabling precise temporal tracking of organoid development. By combining expert annotations with advanced image analysis of organoid morphology, we characterized the heterogeneity of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and lens tissues, as well as global organoid morphologies over time. Using this training set, our deep learning approach accurately predicts the emergence and size of RPE and lens tissue formation as well as similarities in overall organoid morphology on an organoid-by-organoid basis at early developmental stages, refining our understanding of when early lineage decisions are made. This approach advances knowledge of tissue and phenotype decision-making in organoid development and can inform the design of similar predictive platforms for other organoid systems, paving the way for more standardized and reproducible organoid research. Finally, it provides a direct focus on early developmental time points for in-depth molecular analyses, alleviated from confounding effects of heterogeneity.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003597

Thompson, Diane S. Krause, Ellen F. Foxman</p> Interferons (IFNs) are potent antiviral cytokines that are rapidly activated when infected cells sense a virus, but continued IFN production following acute infection is linked to impaired recovery. IFNs protect against infection by inducing a suite of antiviral effectors in IFN receptor-expressing cells via JAK/STAT signaling. However, how IFNs curtail tissue repair is not fully understood. Here, we studied the effects of Type III IFNs (IFNλ1 and IFNλ2) and Type I IFN (IFNβ) on tissue repair functions of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). We show that both Type III IFNs and IFNβ reduce bronchial epithelial cell migration and proliferation through a common upstream mechanism: activation of LATS1, a kinase best known for limiting organ growth as part of the Hippo signaling pathway. Mechanistically, Type III IFN or IFNβ curtailed wound healing by triggering phosphorylation of LATS1 via JAK activity, bypassing activation of MST1/2, the canonical activator of LATS1 in the Hippo pathway. Further experiments showed that distinct signaling pathways lead to LATS1 and STAT1 phosphorylation downstream of IFN receptor signaling. STAT1 was dispensable for IFN-mediated LATS1 phosphorylation and suppression of tissue repair, although as expected STAT1 was required for IFN-mediated protection from rhinovirus or influenza infection. Dose–response curve experiments revealed that higher concentrations of IFN were required to trigger LATS1 phosphorylation compared to STAT1 phosphorylation. Consistently, during rhinovirus or influenza virus infection of organotypic HBEC cultures, we observed phosphorylation of both LATS1 and STAT1, but with different kinetics, with LATS1 activation showing earlier resolution compared to STAT1 activation. These results provide a conceptual framework for understanding how IFN receptor signaling differentially controls epithelial functions required for tissue repair and antiviral defense, and inform efforts to target pathological effects of IFNs following viral infection and in other high IFN states.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003615
1032,The conserved outer mitochondrial membrane protein Mtch regulates mitophagy during <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal development,,,,,,PLOS Biology,B,na,Lucas J. Restrepo; Jasmine K. Graslie; Tina M. Fortier; Eric H. Baehrecke,"<p>by Lucas J. Restrepo, Jasmine K. Graslie, Tina M. Fortier, Eric H. Baehrecke</p> The clearance of mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy) is important for cell health. Mutations in genes that are required for mitophagy, including <i>Vps13D</i>, <i>PINK1</i>, and <i>Parkin</i>, are associated with movement disorders, but gaps exist in our understanding of how Vps13D regulates mitophagy. Here, we identify Mtch (MTCH2 in humans) as a regulator of mitophagy based on a relationship with Vps13D during developmentally programmed mitophagy in <i>Drosophila</i> intestine enterocyte cells. Similar to <i>Vps13D</i> mutant cells, <i>Mtch</i> mutant cells fail to clear mitochondria and possess elevated markers of autophagy. Genetic and molecular experiments reveal that Mtch and Vps13D function in a mitophagy pathway with PINK1, Parkin, and the mitophagy receptor BNIP3. Unlike <i>Vps13D</i> and <i>Parkin</i> mutant cells, <i>Mtch</i> is required for proper expression of the tail-anchored protein BNIP3. Thus, the tail-anchored protein insertase function of Mtch/MTCH2 likely explains how these proteins possess multiple cell context-specific functions.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003616

However, these approaches lack gene locus specificity and may disrupt normal gene regulation. Therefore, new strategies capable of broadly enhancing reprogramming fidelity are needed. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of the pioneer transcription factor Nr5a2 in mouse SCNT embryos improves both zygotic genome activation and the morula-to-blastocyst transition, two major developmental barriers in SCNT, and enhances birth rates. Mechanistically, Nr5a2 recruits P300 to increase H3K27ac at genes with low expression, restoring transcriptional activity and promoting SCNT embryo development.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003611

Unlike seed plants, ferns produce free-living gametophytes that grow independently from their sporophytes. Gametophytes of the model fern <i>Ceratopteris</i> exist in two sex types: hermaphrodites and males. Hermaphrodites maintain meristems and secrete the pheromone antheridiogen, inducing undecided gametophytes to become males. In the absence of antheridiogen, males exhibit developmental plasticity and dynamic cell fate specification by initiating de novo meristems to convert into hermaphrodites. Despite its essential role, the molecular signals governing this process remain unclear. Here, we show that local auxin biosynthesis, dynamically regulated during sex-type conversion, establishes new auxin maxima that are critical for specifying and promoting the proliferation of the meristem progenitor cell (MPC) lineage, ultimately enabling the de novo formation of a multicellular meristem from a single MPC. Time-lapse imaging revealed that upon antheridiogen removal, auxin signaling is specifically activated at the initial site of proliferation in <i>Ceratopteris</i> males, triggering new meristem formation. This auxin signaling subsequently becomes concentrated at the center of the proliferating meristem, aligning with localized auxin biosynthesis and the emergence of the meristem notch. Computationally reconstrued lineage maps further showed that chemical inhibition of CrTAA1 abolishes these dynamic auxin patterns, blocking MPC lineage initiation and its subsequent proliferation. Furthermore, genetic knockout of <i>CrTAA1</i> via CRISPR-Cas9 phenocopies the effects of chemical inhibition, preventing new meristem formation and disrupting male-to-hermaphrodite conversion. Together, these findings uncover a molecular mechanism underlying sex-type conversion in land plants and highlight the pivotal role of de novo auxin biosynthesis in orchestrating cell fate and proliferation during meristem formation.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003592

M. Wong, Brian S. Mautz, Michael D. Jennions</p> Why the human penis is unusually large compared to that of other primates is a long-standing evolutionary question. Sexual selection, through female mate choice and male-male competition, is a likely driver, but confirming this is difficult due to natural covariation among traits. The solution is to experimentally manipulate focal traits to identify targets of selection. Using 343 computer-generated male figures that varied in penis size, height and body shape, we experimentally tested how these traits influence perceived attractiveness and fighting ability. Over 800 participants—both male and female—viewed either life-sized (in-person) or scaled (online) animations and rated the figures. Across both settings, selection analyses revealed consistent directional selection favoring taller men with a more V-shaped body and a larger penis. In both surveys, male participants rated rivals with a larger penis as more sexually competitive and physically threatening. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that males assess rivals’ fighting ability and attractiveness to females based partly on a rival’s penis size. Our findings suggest that female choice and male-male competition have jointly favored larger penis size, greater height, and more V-shaped bodies in men.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003595

Hesseling, Andrew Boulle, Pren Naidoo, Gavin George</p> Tuberculosis (TB) patients who are diagnosed but not registered and initiated on TB treatment are categorised as initial loss to follow-up (ILTFU). ILTFU is a key driver of morbidity and mortality associated with TB and is a contributing factor to high TB transmission rates. LINKEDin was a quasi-experimental study which evaluated two specific interventions for reducing ILTFU in three high-TB burden provinces in South Africa, conducted from October 2018 to December 2020. As part of LINKEDin, we undertook a micro-costing from the healthcare provider perspective using an activity-based costing approach. Cost estimates included the cost of the operation of an integrated provincial health data centre in the Western Cape, apportioned to the TB activities it supported in the province. Cost estimates were linked to intervention outcomes to understand the incremental cost of the intervention per additional patient linked to care compared to rates of ILTFU in the absence of the interventions. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for uncertainty in the intervention outcomes, and for periods where the implementation of the intervention was interrupted due to COVID-19 related disruptions. Costing data were collected between August 2020 and March 2021. The total cost of implementing the LINKEDin intervention in the WC and KZN was $7 534.42 per month. The cost of implementing LINKEDin in the Western Cape accounted for 56% the total cost of the intervention – 8% from the operations of the PHDC and 48% from the cost of running the intervention – while only 44% of the total cost was accounted for by the intervention run in KwaZulu-Natal. The primary cost driver of the interventions were staff salaries, with the cost of data extraction and in-hospital activities low relative to primary healthcare (PHC)-based follow-up activities. In terms of cost effectiveness, the LINKEDin interventions in KZN was cost $377.28 per additional person linked to care, and $243.62 in the WC, per additional person linked to care. In the Western Cape, systematically tracking persons with TB using an automated system proved highly cost efficient compared to the more labour intense approach adopted in KwaZulu-Natal. Optimising the curation and management of data and increasing the effectiveness of tracing systems and processes can result in cost-savings.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0342708

Consecutive patients diagnosed with LMH based on OCT findings who underwent vitrectomy between April 2020 and December 2023 were included. Forty-two patients (male, n = 21; female, n = 21; mean age, 71.3 ± 8.2 years) were included in the study. Preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and OCT parameters, including the presence of inner and outer retinal cysts, epiretinal proliferation (EP), and ellipsoid zone disruption (EZ), were analyzed. Postoperative BCVA was assessed at 6 months after surgery, and postoperative OCT findings were evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months using all available data. Mean BCVA significantly improved from 0.36 ± 0.33 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution preoperatively to 0.15 ± 0.26 at 6 months postoperatively (p < 0.001). The frequency of eyes with inner retinal cysts was 21.4% preoperatively, which gradually decreased to 8.0% at 6 months postoperatively. The frequency of outer retinal cysts was 54.8% preoperatively, which significantly decreased to 12.0% at 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.00937). The presence of EP was significantly correlated with worse postoperative BCVA (p < 0.05). Both preoperative and postoperative EZ disruptions significantly correlated with worse postoperative BCVA (p < 0.05).

1042,Generation of osteoclast-like cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells using <i>NFATc1</i> modified RNA,,,,,,PLOS ONE,C,na,Sirada Srihirun; Chareerut Phruksaniyom; Thanaporn Sriwantana; Tipparat Parakaw; Nathawut Sibmooh; Pornpun Vivithanaporn; Kran Suknuntha,"<p>by Sirada Srihirun, Chareerut Phruksaniyom, Thanaporn Sriwantana, Tipparat Parakaw, Nathawut Sibmooh, Pornpun Vivithanaporn, Kran Suknuntha</p> Inhibition of osteoclasts, a type of bone-resorptive cell, is a key approach for treating diseases associated with bone loss. Although human osteoclasts can be generated from receptor activator of nuclear factor-ĸB ligand-mediated stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro, the differentiation rate is low and the process is time consuming. Here, we aimed to generate osteoclast-like cells from human PBMCs using modified RNA (modRNA) enforcing <i>NFATc1</i>, a master transcription factor that functions downstream of receptor activator of nuclear factor-ĸB receptor activation. Human PBMCs isolated from the venous blood of healthy donors (n = 3) using Histopaque density gradient centrifugation were expanded in medium supplemented with 25 ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 3 days. The isolated macrophages were transfected with <i>NFATc1</i> modRNA. The osteoclast-like cells were evaluated for the following osteoclast-specific markers: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive expression, F-actin ring formation, cathepsin expression, and bone resorption activity. Scanning electron microscopy was used to morphologically characterize the osteoclast-like cells. At day 1 posttransfection with 25, 50, and 100 ng/mL of modRNA, <i>NFATc1</i> expression in human macrophages increased by 1.20 ± 0.08-fold, 3.47 ± 1.02-fold, and 13.31 ± 3.96-fold, respectively. Transfection with 25 or 50 ng/mL of <i>NFATc1</i> modRNA for 3 days induced the formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells, the F-actin ring formation, expression of cathepsin K, and increased bone resorption activity. Scanning electron micrographs confirmed the presence of round, multinucleated cells with projecting microvilli, characteristic of osteoclasts. In conclusion, rapid generation of functional osteoclast-like cells was achieved in vitro using <i>NFATc1</i> modRNA. This method offers faster results compared with conventional receptor activator of nuclear factor-ĸB ligand stimulation.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0342642

Välimäki, Saana Pohjavaara, Emilie Indersie, Stefano Cairo, Aarni Kuusinen, Heikki Ruskoaho, Markku Heikinheimo</p> Hepatoblastoma is the most common pediatric liver tumor, and it primarily affects young children. Despite improved treatment results due to modern chemotherapy and advanced surgical techniques, there is urgent need to improve the long-term prognosis of hepatoblastoma patients. Elevated expression of transcription factor GATA4 has been associated with pro-tumorigenic functions in hepatoblastoma. Herein, we explored the effects of a novel series of GATA4-targeted compounds (3i-2010–3i-2014) in several hepatoblastoma cell models. To this end, we assessed cell viability (2D and 3D), caspase 3/7 activity, cell cycle process with automated fluorescence microscopy, and RNA and protein expression using quantitative PCR, RNA-sequencing, and western blotting after treating cells with GATA4-targeted compounds. The GATA4-targeted compounds reduced hepatoblastoma cell viability but affected also healthy control cells when high doses were applied. Out of the five compounds used, the 3i-2012 was the most potent. This compound induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, increased caspase activity, and resulted in changes in transcriptome of hepatoblastoma cells. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were associated with cell cycle regulation. Transcription factor target analysis demonstrated that a notable proportion of DEGs were likely regulated by GATA4. In conclusion, 3i-2012 decreases hepatoblastoma cell survival by disturbing cell cycle regulation in the tumor cells.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0342565
1047,Evidence for genetic correlation between appendix and inflammatory bowel disease: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study,,,,,,PLOS ONE,C,na,Dan Liu; Wanyue Dan; Bin Yan; Lihua Peng; Fei Pan,"<p>by Dan Liu, Wanyue Dan, Bin Yan, Lihua Peng, Fei Pan</p> Background <p>Observational studies highlighted a link between the appendix and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but proving causality has been difficult due to the lack of a clear temporal sequence.</p> Methods <p>This research used a two-sample bidirectional univariable Mendelian randomization (MR), multivariable MR and linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) analyses to explore the relationship between acute appendicitis, appendectomy, and IBD. Eligible instrumental variables were screened from previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of European ancestry for analysis. The inverse variance-weighted method was used for the primary analysis. Sensitivity analyses were used to detect and correct pleiotropy. LDSC analysis determined SNP-based heritability (h2) for acute appendicitis, IBD, Crohn’s disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC). Following that, cross-trait LDSC analysis assessed genetic correlations (rg) between these traits using GWAS summary data.</p> Results <p>Genetically predicted UC was significantly associated with a lower risk of acute appendicitis (OR = 0.933, 95% CI 0.911–0.957, p < 0.001) and appendectomy (OR = 0.954, 95% CI 0.932–0.976, p < 0.001). Conversely, no causal effect was observed from acute appendicitis or appendectomy on IBD, UC, or CD. While a suggestive association was noted for CD with appendectomy in univariable analysis, it did not remain significant after multivariable adjustment for the influence of UC. A significant negative genetic correlation further supported the inverse relationship between UC and acute appendicitis (rg = −0.205, p = 0.005).</p> Conclusions <p>In conclusion, genetically predicted UC was causally associated with a decreased risk of acute appendicitis and appendectomy, but neither acute appendicitis nor appendectomy has a causal impact on the risk of IBD, UC, or CD. These findings suggest that ulcerative colitis (UC) may confer a protective effect against the development of acute appendicitis, offering valuable insights into the shared genetic architecture and potential biological mechanisms underlying these conditions.</p>",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0342541
1048,Verification of reference intervals for routine biochemical tests using the reflimR in Turkish adults,,,,,,PLOS ONE,C,na,Levent Deniz; Ozlem Demirelce,"<p>by Levent Deniz, Ozlem Demirelce</p> This study aimed to verify the reference interval(s) (RIs) for routine biochemistry tests in adult Turkish population using the reflimR method and compare them with the manufacturer-provided RIs. The RIs of 19 routine biochemical parameters, analyzed using Beckman Coulter analyzers between February and October 2024, were evaluated using the reflimR algorithm. The RIs were estimated separately for females and males using five indirect approaches (reflimR, refineR, KOSMIC, Hoffmann, and Bhattacharya). A traffic light algorithm based on permissible uncertainty was used to interpret whether the RIs limits calculated with reflimR were within the tolerance limits. Using reflimR, 40 of 76 RI limits were accepted, 21 required checking, and 15 were rejected for RI verification compared with the manufacturer-provided values. The comparison of reflimR with other indirect methods generally produced concordant results, except for the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and total bilirubin tests. The reflimR algorithm may offer a swift and accessible method for calculating and verifying RIs. Verification failures may arise from fundamental variations, including ethnicity, sex, age demographics, and geographic factors, between the manufacturer’s study results and our analyzed population.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0342530

In Ghana, despite a high burden of non-communicable diseases and the existence of employee health and wellbeing programme, evidence on how nurses with hypertension navigate their personal health management remains limited, particularly in high-stress settings like those in rural part of Ghana.</p> Aim <p>We explored the health seeking behaviors of nurses diagnosed with hypertension and providing health care in a resource-constrained setting in a rural part of Northern Ghana.</p> Methods <p>The study employed a qualitative, exploratory-descriptive design. Through purposive sampling, twelve (12) nurses diagnosed with hypertension were recruited from the Kintampo Municipal Hospital’s Employee Wellness Clinic. Data was collected via in-depth, semi-structured interviews which were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis, guided by Braun and Clarke’s framework and supported by NVivo 14.0 software, was used to assist with the data analysis.</p> Results <p>The analysis yielded nine major themes. The participants demonstrated high biomedical knowledge and perceived hypertension as a severe condition, strongly linked to occupational stress. Key barriers to effective management included overwhelming workload and scheduling constraints, financial limitations, a pervasive culture of professional self-reliance and stigma, and a critical lack of institutional support systems. While family and peer support were vital facilitators, they were insufficient to overcome systemic barriers. Nurses exhibited strong self-management practices, but their health-seeking was often reactive rather than preventive.</p> Conclusion and recommendations <p>A significant gap exists between nurses’ knowledge of hypertension and their health-seeking actions. This gap is primarily driven by organizational and systemic barriers within the workplace, rather than a lack of individual awareness. To protect this critical workforce, we recommend that nurse managers, hospital management and health policymakers must prioritize the implementation of structured, low-cost workplace wellness programmes. These should include routine screening, flexible scheduling, anti-stigma campaigns to promote health-seeking, and confidential peer support systems to enable nurses to translate their knowledge into consistent self-care practices when diagnosed with hypertension.</p>",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0342406

This multi-country, multi-centre test-negative case-control study assessed the effectiveness and durability of the BNT162b2 XBB vaccine in preventing JN.1-associated hospitalisation among adults with severe acute respiratory infection between October 2023 and August 2024. Each case was matched with up to four controls by symptom onset date and study site. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for symptom onset date, age, sex, number of chronic conditions, and influenza vaccination receipt.</p> Results <p>Among 827 test-positive cases and 2232 test-negative controls, protection against hospitalisation was sustained from two to <30 weeks since dose, with evidence of significant waning thereafter. VE was 64.5% (95% CI: 56.6; 71.0) at two to <30 weeks, and 4.9% (95% CI: −30.3; 30.7) at 30 to <46 weeks.</p> Conclusion <p>Despite the vaccine target not matching the predominant subvariant, BNT162b2 XBB vaccine protected against JN.1-related hospitalisation for up to 30 weeks. Protection against hospitalisation was non-significant after 30 weeks since dose, potentially due to further shift in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains and/or waning immunity. Given the high COVID-19 activity in Europe during summer 2024, an additional vaccination after six months is warranted for those at risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation to maintain year-round protection.</p>",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0342382

This study aimed to evaluate cytokine profiles in the aqueous humor of nAMD patients and explore correlation between specific cytokines, clinical characteristics, and retinal morphological features.</p> Methods <p>Our protocol was registered on Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) under registration number ChiCTR2500106190 and approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of West China Hospital, Sichuan University (ID: 20231375). A total of 94 patients with nAMD and 34 cataract patients as the control group were enrolled. Aqueous humor samples were collected before anti-VEGF treatment or cataract surgery, and analyzed using cytometric bead array (CBA) for cytokines (MCP-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CA-1, β-FGF, PPK/PK, and VEGF). Retinal structural biomarkers were assessed using optical coherence tomography (OCT), with statistical analysis performed to evaluate correlations between cytokine levels and retinal morphology.</p> Results <p>Compared to cataract patients, nAMD patients exhibited elevated levels of CA-1, PPK/PK, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MCP-1 (P < 0.05). Baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was reduced in nAMD patients with intraretinal fluid (IRF) or pigmentation compared to those without (P < 0.05). Visit BCVA also deteriorated in patients with fibrosis (P < 0.05). Additionally, central foveal thickness (CTR) was significantly thinner in patients with PED or SRF (P < 0.05). Visit BCVA demonstrated positive correlations with baseline BCVA (r = 0.689, P < 0.001). In contrast, the presence of fibrosis and elevated MCP-1 concentration was associated with a poorer visual outcome. In correlation analysis, β-FGF exhibited a negative correlation with CA-1, PPK, ICAM-1. VCAM-1 and MCP-1.</p> Conclusion <p>In this cross-sectional study, the presence of IRF was significantly associated with reduced BCVA in nAMD patients. Baseline BCVA emerged as a critical predictor of visual prognosis in nAMD. Notably, retinal fibrosis development and elevated MCP-1 level linked to worse clinical outcomes, underscoring their potential as therapeutic targets. While recent anti-VEGF injections decreased VEGF levels in aqueous humor of nAMD patients, the impact of these agents on other cytokines remain unclear, suggesting a need for adjunct therapies to address multifaceted pathogenic pathways.</p>",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0342259

Moreover, lifestyle changes were widely reported as a result of preventive measures against the novel coronavirus disease 2019. We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate lifestyle factors associated with a pre-disease condition prior to MetS in young adults during/post-pandemic era. A survey was distributed to fourth-year students at Nagasaki University in 2023, and medical examination data were collected. Participants who met both high intra-abdominal fat area (IAFA >71.1 cm²) and at least one of the Japanese diagnostic criteria for MetS were categorized as having pre-MetS. The pre-MetS group was compared with the control (non–pre-MetS) group to examine its characteristics using Fisher’s exact test and binomial logistic regression. A total of 856 students participated in this study; of them, 43 (5.0%) were classified as the pre-MetS group. Fisher’s exact test identified significant associations between pre-MetS and breakfast frequency of 2–3 times/week, dining out ≥4 times/week, no or infrequent part-time job, late bedtime, and longer gaming time. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that after mutual adjustment, pre-MetS remained associated with no or infrequent part-time job and longer gaming time. After further adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index, only no or infrequent part-time job and gaming time of ≥4 h/day were significantly associated with pre-MetS. These factors were associated with pre-MetS and might reflect early metabolic alterations; further prospective studies are needed in this regard.",,,,,,,,,True,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0342228

Valente; Maríndia Deprá,"Gene duplication and transposable element (TE) insertions are key drivers of genome evolution and have been linked to increased insecticide resistance in insects. The aim of this study was to characterize the distribution and potential impact of TEs within and near cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) genes in the invasive pest Drosophila suzukii compared with the non-pest Drosophila melanogaster . We performed in silico analyses of the CYP gene repertoire and genome architecture in D. suzukii and D. melanogaster . We identified ten duplicated CYP genes that are exclusive to D. suzukii and absent from its closely related species D. melanogaster . These duplications are enriched with TE fragments, predominantly Helitrons. Thirty-six percent of TE sequences within CYP genes and their flanking regions carry putative transcription-factor binding sites in D. suzukii , indicating a possible role in gene regulation. Building on the proposed model of Helitron-mediated exon shuffling, our findings suggest that these elements contribute to gene rearrangement, thereby potentially enhancing functional diversity. At the genome level, D. suzukii harbors a higher overall TE content than D. melanogaster , with a relative enrichment within CYP genes. The increased TE content may have enhanced genomic plasticity, thereby facilitating the species’ invasive success, rapid population growth, and ability to adapt to diverse habitats, such as native environments and agricultural fields.",,,,,,,,,False,1,10.3389/fevo.2025.1664211

However, systematic analysis and comparison of the expansion of the P450 gene superfamily and its potential mechanisms in different biological groups remains limited. Here, we analyzed one million P450 gene sequences from Viridiplantae, Metazoa, Fungi, and Bacteria by integrating protein language models, phylogenetic inference, and gene duplication pattern analysis to resolve their evolutionary trajectories. Our results show that P450 genes expanded primarily through vertical inheritance, but 24 potential cross-group horizontal gene transfer events were also detected. Ecological analyses suggest a potential link between P450 expansion and the complexity of terrestrial niches: P450s are abundant in Viridiplantae and Fungi, with large-scale expansions in Metazoa and Bacteria restricted to specific lineages. Comparative duplication analyses highlight distinct group-specific mechanisms: Viridiplantae are driven by synergistic whole-genome duplication and tandem duplication; Metazoa expand mainly via tandem duplication, facilitating rapid functional diversification; Fungi rely predominantly on dispersed duplication, enhancing metabolic plasticity; and Bacteria maintain their ability to survive under environmental stress by dispersed duplication. At the family level, we identified three typical expansion patterns: high coverage with low copy number (e.g., CYP51), high coverage with high copy number (e.g., CYP71), and low coverage with high copy number (e.g., CYP725). These patterns collectively support core, secondary, and specialized metabolic functions in different biological groups. This study reveals the expansion patterns and driving factors of the P450 gene superfamily across biological groups, offering new genomic insights into its evolutionary diversification.",,,,,,,,,False,1,10.3389/fevo.2025.1713618
